HCO+ is detected and mapped at 0"3 resolution in all five disks, while H13CO+ is detected (S/N {$>$} 6{$\sigma$}) toward GM Aur and HD 163296 and tentatively detected (S/N {$>$} 3{$\sigma$}) toward the other disks by a matched filter analysis. Inside a radius of R \textasciitilde{} 100 au, the HCO+ column density is flat or shows a central dip. At outer radii ({$\greaterequivlnt$}100 au), the HCO+ column density decreases outward, while the column density ratio of HCO+/CO is mostly in the range of \textasciitilde 10-5-10-4. We derived the HCO+ abundance in the warm CO-rich layer, where HCO+ is expected to be the dominant molecular ion. At R {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 au, the HCO+ abundance is \textasciitilde 3 \texttimes{} 10-11 - 3 \texttimes{} 10-10, which is consistent with a template disk model with X-ray ionization. At the smaller radii, the abundance decreases inward, which indicates that the ionization degree is lower in denser gas, especially inside the CO snow line, where the CO-rich layer is in the midplane. Comparison of template disk models with the column densities of HCO+, N2H+, and N2D+ indicates that the midplane ionization rate is {$\greaterequivlnt$}10-18 s-1 for the disks around IM Lup, AS 209, and HD 163296. We also find hints of an increased HCO+ abundance around the location of dust continuum gaps in AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480.

  abstract = {We have conducted a survey of young single and multiple systems in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), substantially improving both the spatial resolution and sensitivity with which individual protoplanetary disks in these systems have been observed. These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25-30 au and have an average 3{$\sigma$} detection level of 0.35 mJy, equivalent to a disk mass of 4 \texttimes{} 10-5 M {$\odot$} for an M3 star. Our sample was constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher-order multiple systems observed, we detect {$\lambda$} = 1.3 mm continuum emission from one or more stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected disks to over 75\% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the wealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations of 30-4200 au have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar mass than single stars. We also find that for these systems, the circumstellar disk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk mass in the system and contains on average 62\% of the total mass.},

  abstract = {Emission substructures in gas and dust are common in protoplanetary disks. Such substructures can be linked to planet formation or planets themselves. We explore the observed gas substructures in AS 209 using thermochemical modeling with RAC2D and high-spatial-resolution data from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) program. The observations of C18O J = 2-1 emission exhibit a strong depression at 88 au overlapping with the positions of multiple gaps in millimeter dust continuum emission. We find that the observed CO column density is consistent with either gas surface-density perturbations or chemical processing, while C2H column density traces changes in the C/O ratio rather than the H2 gas surface density. However, the presence of a massive planet ({$>$}0.2 MJup) would be required to account for this level of gas depression, which conflicts with constraints set by the dust emission and the pressure profile measured by gas kinematics. Based on our models, we infer that a local decrease of CO abundance is required to explain the observed structure in CO, dominating over a possible gap-carving planet present and its effect on the H2 surface density.

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations from the 2014 Long Baseline Campaign in dust continuum and spectral line emission from the HL Tau region. The continuum images at wavelengths of 2.9, 1.3, and 0.87 mm have unprecedented angular resolutions of 0.{${''}$} 075 (10 AU) to 0.{${''}$} 025 (3.5 AU), revealing an astonishing level of detail in the circumstellar disk surrounding the young solar analog HL Tau, with a pattern of bright and dark rings observed at all wavelengths. By fitting ellipses to the most distinct rings, we measure precise values for the disk inclination (46\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 72+/- 0\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 05) and position angle (+138\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 02+/- 0\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 07). We obtain a high-fidelity image of the 1.0 mm spectral index ({$\alpha$}), which ranges from {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 2.0 in the optically thick central peak and two brightest rings, increasing to 2.3-3.0 in the dark rings. The dark rings are not devoid of emission, and we estimate a grain emissivity index of 0.8 for the innermost dark ring and lower for subsequent dark rings, consistent with some degree of grain growth and evolution. Additional clues that the rings arise from planet formation include an increase in their central offsets with radius and the presence of numerous orbital resonances. At a resolution of 35 AU, we resolve the molecular component of the disk in HCO+ (1-0) which exhibits a pattern over LSR velocities from 2-12 km s-1 consistent with Keplerian motion around a {$\sim$}1.3 \{M\}{$\odot$} star, although complicated by absorption at low blueshifted velocities. We also serendipitously detect and resolve the nearby protostars XZ Tau (A/B) and LkH{$\alpha$}358 at 2.9 mm. .},

An expanded sample is constructed to probe disk structures that emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities (hence dust masses), down to the median value for T Tauri stars. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk are simultaneously reproduced with a two-dimensional parametric model for a viscous accretion disk that has a surface density profile {$\Sigma$} vprop (R/Rc )-{$\gamma$}exp [ - (R/Rc )2-{$\gamma$}]. We find wide ranges of characteristic radii (Rc = 14-198 AU) and disk masses (Md = 0.004-0.143 M sun), but a narrow distribution of surface density gradients ({$\gamma$} = 0.4-1.1) that is consistent with a uniform value lang{$\gamma$}rang = 0.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 and independent of mass (or millimeter luminosity). In this sample, we find a correlation between the disk luminosity/mass and characteristic radius, such that fainter disks are both smaller and less massive. We suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initial conditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch, compare their angular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores, and speculate on how future observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolution timescales. No other correlations between disk and star properties are found. The inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models for giant planet formation, although resolution limitations do not permit us to directly comment on material inside R {$\approx$} 20 AU. However, there is some compelling evidence for the evolution of dust in the planet formation region: 4/17 disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced millimeter optical depths within \textasciitilde 20-40 AU of their central stars.},

We present new and archival high angular resolution (0farcs3 {$\approx$} 40-75 AU) Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the 880 {$\mu$}m (340 GHz) dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearby star-forming regions. In each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central star. Using two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric model framework by reproducing their SMA continuum visibilities and spectral energy distributions. The cavities in these disks are large (R cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small (\textasciitilde{$\mu$}m-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. The structures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal disks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are relatively common among the millimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 1 in 5 (20\%) of the disks in the bright half (and {$>$}=26\% of the upper quartile) of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution. Utilizing these results, we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to account for transition disk structures. As has been shown before, photoevaporation models do not produce the large cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk masses representative of this sample. A sufficient decrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth would be difficult to achieve: substantial growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of AU) regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small particles. Given those challenges, we suggest instead that the observations are most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions with low-mass companions\textemdash very young (\textasciitilde 1 Myr) brown dwarfs or giant planets on long-period orbits.},

Using continuum and line radiative transfer calculations, these data and the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution are analyzed together in the context of simple two-dimensional parametric disk structure models. Under the assumptions of a radially invariant dust population and gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are unable to simultaneously reproduce the CO and dust observations with model structures that employ either a single, distinct outer boundary or a smooth (exponential) taper at large radii. Instead, we find that the distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains in the TW Hya disk has a relatively sharp edge near 60 AU, contrary to the CO emission (and optical/infrared scattered light) that extends to a much larger radius of at least 215 AU. We discuss some possible explanations for the observed radial distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains and the apparent CO-dust size discrepancy, and suggest that they may be hallmarks of substructure in the dust disk or natural signatures of the growth and radial drift of solids that might be expected for disks around older pre-main-sequence stars like TW Hya.},

These data reveal a series of concentric ring-shaped substructures in the form of bright zones and narrow dark annuli (1-6 au) with modest contrasts (5\%-30\%). We associate these features with concentrations of solids that have had their inward radial drift slowed or stopped, presumably at local gas pressure maxima. No significant non-axisymmetric structures are detected. Some of the observed features occur near temperatures that may be associated with the condensation fronts of major volatile species, but the relatively small brightness contrasts may also be a consequence of magnetized disk evolution (the so-called zonal flows). Other features, particularly a narrow dark annulus located only 1 au from the star, could indicate interactions between the disk and young planets. These data signal that ordered substructures on {$\sim$}au scales can be common, fundamental factors in disk evolution and that high-resolution microwave imaging can help characterize them during the epoch of planet formation.},

These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few astronomical units to more than 100 au), are usually compact ({$\lessequivlnt$}10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying articles.

  abstract = {We present a combined, homogenized analysis of archival Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the spatially resolved 340 GHz (870 {$\mu$}m) continuum emission from 105 nearby protoplanetary disks. Building on the previous SMA survey, we infer surface brightness profiles using a simple model of the observed visibilities to derive the luminosities (L mm) and effective sizes (R eff) of the continuum emission. With this sample, we confirm the shapes, normalizations, and dispersions for the strong correlations between L mm, M * (or L *), and \{\textbackslash dot\{M\}\}* found in previous studies. We also verify the continuum size-luminosity relation determined from the SMA survey alone (extending to an order of magnitude lower L mm), demonstrating that the amount of emission scales linearly with the emitting surface area. Moreover, we identify new, although weaker, relationships between R eff and the host and accretion properties, such that disks are larger around more massive hosts with higher accretion rates. We explore these interrelated demographic properties with some highly simplified approximations. These multi-dimensional relationships can be explained if the emission is optically thick with a filling factor of {$\sim$}0.3, or if the emission is optically thin and disks have roughly the same optical depth profile shapes and normalizations independent of host properties. In both scenarios, we require the dust disk sizes to have a slightly sublinear relationship with the host mass and a non-negligible dispersion ({$\sim$}0.2 dex at a given M *).},

  abstract = {The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes\textemdash presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima\textemdash broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

  abstract = {We present the first high-resolution sub-millimeter survey of both dust and gas for a large population of protoplanetary disks. Characterizing fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks on a statistical level is critical to understanding how disks evolve into the diverse exoplanet population. We use the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) to survey 89 protoplanetary disks around stars with \{M\}* 0.1 \{M\}{$\odot$} in the young (1-3 Myr), nearby (150-200 pc) Lupus complex. Our observations cover the 890 {$\mu$}m continuum and the 13CO and C18O 3-2 lines. We use the sub-millimeter continuum to constrain \{M\}\{\{dust\}\} to a few Martian masses (0.2-0.4 M {$\oplus$}) and the CO isotopologue lines to constrain \{M\}\{\{gas\}\} to roughly a Jupiter mass (assuming an interstellar medium (ISM)-like [\{CO\}]/[\{\{\{H\}\}\}2] abundance). Of 89 sources, we detect 62 in continuum, 36 in 13CO, and 11 in C18O at 3{$\sigma$} significance. Stacking individually undetected sources limits their average dust mass to {$\lessequivlnt$} 6 Lunar masses (0.03 M {$\oplus$}), indicating rapid evolution once disk clearing begins. We find a positive correlation between \{M\}\{\{dust\}\} and M *, and present the first evidence for a positive correlation between \{M\}\{\{gas\}\} and M *, which may explain the dependence of giant planet frequency on host star mass. The mean dust mass in Lupus is 3\texttimes{} higher than in Upper Sco, while the dust mass distributions in Lupus and Taurus are statistically indistinguishable. Most detected disks have \{M\}\{\{gas\}\}{$\lessequivlnt$} 1 \{M\}\{\{Jup\}\} and gas-to-dust ratios 100, assuming an ISM-like [\{CO\}]/[\{\{\{H\}\}\}2] abundance; unless CO is very depleted, the inferred gas depletion indicates that planet formation is well underway by a few Myr and may explain the unexpected prevalence of super-Earths in the exoplanet population.},

The spatial resolution is {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}25 with a medium 3{$\sigma$} continuum sensitivity of 0.30 mJy, corresponding to M dust {$\sim$} 0.2 M {$\oplus$}. We apply Keplerian masking to enhance the signal-to-noise ratios of our 12CO zero-moment maps, enabling measurements of gas disk radii for 22 Lupus disks; we find that gas disks are universally larger than millimeter dust disks by a factor of two on average, likely due to a combination of the optically thick gas emission and the growth and inward drift of the dust. Using the gas disk radii, we calculate the dimensionless viscosity parameter, {$\alpha$} visc, finding a broad distribution and no correlations with other disk or stellar parameters, suggesting that viscous processes have not yet established quasi-steady states in Lupus disks. By combining our 1.33 mm continuum fluxes with our previous 890 {$\mu$}m continuum observations, we also calculate the millimeter spectral index, {$\alpha$} mm, for 70 Lupus disks; we find an anticorrelation between {$\alpha$} mm and millimeter flux for low-mass disks (M dust {$\lessequivlnt$} 5), followed by a flattening as disks approach {$\alpha$} mm {$\approx$} 2, which could indicate faster grain growth in higher-mass disks, but may also reflect their larger optically thick components. In sum, this work demonstrates the continuous stream of new insights into disk evolution and planet formation that can be gleaned from unbiased ALMA disk surveys.},

  abstract = {Using a generalized torque formula for Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating gaseous disks we study the interaction of disks with small, embedded bodies (not able to open a gap). For satellites on circular orbits, the generalized torque formula reproduces exactly the torque cutoff occurring at high azimuthal number m of the potential harmonics, originally found seminumerically by Goldreich \& Tremaine (1980) in the shearing coordinates representation. The cutoff is attributable to the shift in the effective Lindblad resonance position with respect to the nominal resonant radius given by the usual period commensurabilty requirement. We apply the theory to the problem of orbital eccentricity evolution of embedded satellites. We relax some of the assumptions implicit in previous calculations related to this problem, most importantly that of a spatially smooth perturbing potential. We treat the co-orbital and the external Lindblad resonances within a unified formalism. We calculate the total rate of eccentricity damping due to co-orbital resonances and the excitation due to external resonances, the former exceeding the latter by a factor roughly equal to 3, independent of the method of averaging over the vertical disk structure. In application to a solar nebula with embedded planetesimals, the timescales of eccentricity damping for a wide range of planetesimal masses are much shorter than those corresponding to either gas drag, planetesimal growth, or nebular lifetime, and thus relevant to the scenarios of planetary system formation. In application to large (radius {$>$} 10 m) particles in Saturn's rings we estimate that the eccentricity is damped on the orbital timescale},

  abstract = {The existing theory of density wave excitation in two-dimensional gaseous disks by imposed gravitational potentials makes approximations which prevent a direct analytical description of the shifts in effective positions of Lindblad resonances with respect to radii satisfying orbital commensurability requirement, and of the so-called torque cutoff arising at large azimuthal numbers m of the perturbing potential's pattern. Both phenomena are related to the azimuthal forces acting on gas, neglected in the WKB approximation commonly used in the past. We extend previous theories of Lindblad resonance wherever necessary for a consistent analytical treatment of the problem, particularly for large m. Our analytical approach applies to wave excitation at Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating, two-dimensional gas layers (vertically averaged disks or fundamental vertical mode of three-dimensional disks). It explicitly includes the resonance shifts and torque cutoffs. The theory is valid for small perturbing potentials of arbitrary form (including highly localized potentials, e.g., point-mass potential, spiral potential with arbitrary pitch angle, etc.). We present a torque formula generalizing the standard Goldreich-Tremaine formula. Especially useful in the problem of disk-satellite interaction, the torque formula provides insight into the origin of the torque cutoff at m larger than the radius to thickness ratio of the disk. Qualitatively, the cutoff is an effect of: (i) a mild (power-law) intrinsic torque cutoff, independent of the radial profile of the imposed potential, and (ii) a sharp (exponential) cutoff due to shifts in effective resonance location away from the perturber. For m \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} the latter effect causes the increasingly localized potential to decouple spatially from the wave generation region. A disk annulus surrounding the corotation radius of every m-armed potential, of width comparable with twice the vertical disk scale height, remains evanescent for waves excited by that harmonic and does not contribute significantly to the total torque between the perturber and the disk. We discuss the role of gas viscosity, self-gravity, and the applicability of a two-dimensional analysis to Lindblad resonances in three-dimensional disks.},

  abstract = {We investigate the gravitational interaction of a generally eccentric binary star system with circumbinary and circumstellar gaseous disks. The disks are assumed to be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent) viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of the binary truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and eccentricity in this quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap sizes with results of direct simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement. As a by-product of the computations, we verify that standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and with a denoting the binary semimajor axis, the inner edge location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum separation between a component star and the circumbinary disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary disk truncation to the size required by one proposed spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances, even if the disk is nonviscous.},

All observations successfully detect the disks, which appear vastly different in size, from {$\approx$}80 au in scattered light to {$>$}400 au, and display total polarized disk fluxes between 0.06\% and 0.89\% of the stellar flux. For five of these disks, we are able to determine the three-dimensional structure and the flaring of the disk surface, which appears to be relatively consistent across the different disks, with flaring exponents {$\alpha$} between {$\approx$}1.1 and {$\approx$}1.6. We also confirm literature results with regard to the inclination and position angle of several of our disks and are able to determine which side is the near side of the disk in most cases. While there is a clear trend of disk mass with stellar ages ({$\approx$}1 to {$>$}10 Myr), no correlations of disk structures with age were found. There are also no correlations with either stellar mass or submillimeter flux. We do not detect significant differences between the J and H bands. However, we note that while a high fraction (7/8) of the disks in our sample show ring-shaped substructures, none of them display spirals, in contrast to the disks around more massive Herbig Ae/Be stars, where spiral features are common.

  abstract = {We carry out two-fluid, two-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations to test whether protostellar infall can trigger the Rossby wave instability (RWI) in protoplanetry disks. Our results show that infall can trigger the RWI and generate vortices near the outer edge of the mass landing on the disk (i.e., centrifugal radius). We find that the RWI is triggered under a variety of conditions, although the details depend on the disk parameters and the infall pattern. The common key feature of triggering the RWI is the steep radial gradient of the azimuthal velocity induced by the local increase in density at the outer edge of the infall region. Vortices form when the instability enters the nonlinear regime. In our standard model where self-gravity is neglected, vortices merge together to a single vortex within {$\sim$}20 local orbital times, and the merged vortex survives for the remaining duration of the calculation ({$>$}170 local orbital times). The vortex takes part in outward angular momentum transport, with a Reynolds stress of {$\lessequivlnt$}10-2. Our two-fluid calculations show that vortices efficiently trap dust particles with stopping times of the order of the orbital time, locally enhancing the dust to gas ratio for particles of the appropriate size by a factor of {$\sim$}40 in our standard model. When self-gravity is considered, however, vortices tend to be impeded from merging and may eventually dissipate. We conclude it may well be that protoplanetary disks have favorable conditions for vortex formation during the protostellar infall phase, which might enhance early planetary core formation.},

  abstract = {Combining hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with dust evolution models, we show that protoplanetary disks with a giant planet can reveal diverse morphology in (sub)millimeter continuum, including a full disk without significant radial structure, a transition disk with an inner cavity, a disk with a single gap and a central continuum peak, and a disk with multiple rings and gaps. Such diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous transport in the disk, which determines the number of gaps a planet can open; (2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emissivity of the disk at (sub)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to observe the disk. In particular, our results show that disks with the same underlying gas distribution can have very different grain size/spatial distributions and thus appearance in continuum, depending on the interplay among coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This suggests that proper treatments for the grain growth have to be included in models of protoplanetary disks concerning continuum properties and that complementary molecular line observations are highly desired in addition to continuum observations to reveal the true nature of disks. The fact that a single planet can produce diverse disk morphology emphasizes the need to search for more direct, localized signatures of planets in order to confirm (or dispute) the planetary origin of observed ringed substructures.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more than one spiral arm, possibly explaining the recent observations of multiple spiral arms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet excites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous speculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be understood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A planet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching spiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is in phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral arm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference can occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching position of the spiral arms being dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk temperature profile. Nonlinear effects become increasingly important as the planet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus larger pitch angles. This is found to be common for both primary and additional arms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ({$\greaterequivlnt$}3 thermal masses for (h/r) p = 0.1), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave modes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the primary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms can provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We examine whether various characteristics of planet-driven spiral arms can be used to constrain the masses of unseen planets and their positions within their disks. By carrying out two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations varying planet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number of spiral arms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet excites two or more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk temperatures characterized by the disk aspect ratio 0.04{$\leq$}slant \{(h/r)\}p{$\leq$}slant 0.15, whereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can form only in cold disks with \{(h/r)\}p{$\lessequivlnt$} 0.06. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch angle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might be challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of planet-driven spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a powerful diagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to the observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of planet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends on disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm separations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in MWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al., planet-driven spiral arms can create concentric rings and gaps, which can produce a more dominant observable signature than spiral arms under certain circumstances. We discuss the observability of planet-driven spiral arms versus rings and gaps.},

  abstract = {Besides the spirals induced by the Lindblad resonances, planets can generate a family of tightly wound spirals through buoyancy resonances. The excitation of buoyancy resonances depends on the thermal relaxation timescale of the gas. By computing timescales of various processes associated with thermal relaxation, namely, radiation, diffusion, and gas-dust collision, we show that the thermal relaxation in protoplanetary disks' surface layers (Z/R {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1) and outer disks (R {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 au) is limited by infrequent gas-dust collisions. The use of the isothermal equation of state or rapid cooling, common in protoplanetary disk simulations, is therefore not justified. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the collision-limited slow thermal relaxation provides favorable conditions for buoyancy resonances to develop. Buoyancy resonances produce predominantly vertical motions, whose magnitude at the 12CO emission surface is of the order of 100 m s-1 for Jovian-mass planets, sufficiently large to detect using molecular line observations with ALMA. We generate synthetic observations and describe characteristic features of buoyancy resonances in Keplerian-subtracted moment maps and velocity channel maps. Based on the morphology and magnitude of the perturbation, we propose that the tightly wound spirals observed in TW Hya could be driven by a (sub-)Jovian-mass planet at 90 au. We discuss how non-Keplerian motions driven by buoyancy resonances can be distinguished from those driven by other origins. We argue that observations of multiple lines tracing different heights, with sufficiently high spatial/spectral resolution and sensitivity to separate the emission arising from the near and far sides of the disk, will help constrain the origin of non-Keplerian motions.},

To this end, we perform a set of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanets with small eccentricities (e {$\leq$} 0.1). We adopt an isothermal equation of state and concentrate resolution on the protoplanet to investigate flows down to the scale of the protoplanet's circumplanetary disk (CPD). We find enhanced prograde rotation exterior to the CPD for low planet masses undergoing subsonic eccentric motion. If the eccentricity is made large enough to develop a bow shock, this trend reverses and rotation becomes increasingly retrograde. The instantaneous eccentric flow field is dramatically altered compared to circular orbits. Whereas the latter exhibits a generic pattern of polar inflow and midplane outflow, the flow geometry depends on the orbital phase in the eccentric case. For even the modest eccentricities tested here, the dominant source of inflow can come from the midplane instead of the poles. We find that the amount of inflow and outflow increases for higher e and lower protoplanet masses, thereby recycling more gas through the planet's Bondi radius. These increased fluxes may increase the pebble accretion rate for eccentric planets up to several times that of the circular orbit rate. In response to the eccentric motion, the structure and rotation of the planet's bound CPD remain unchanged. Because the CPD regulates the eventual accretion of gas onto the planet, we predict little change to the gas accretion rates between eccentric and circular planets.},

  abstract = {The great diversity of extrasolar planetary systems has challenged our understanding of how planets form and how their orbits evolve as they form. Among the various processes that may account for this diversity, the gravitational interaction between planets and their parent protoplanetary disk plays a prominent role in shaping young planetary systems. Planet-disk forces are large, and the characteristic times for the evolution of planets' orbital elements are much shorter than the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. The determination of such forces is challenging, because it involves many physical mechanisms and requires detailed knowledge of the disk structure. Yet intense research over the past few years, with the exploration of many new avenues, represents a significant improvement on the state of the discipline. This chapter reviews the current understanding of planet-disk interactions and highlights their role in setting the properties and architecture of observed planetary systems.},

The waves are numerically resolved in the vertical and radial directions. Both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified accretion discs are considered. The waves are generated by means of resonant forcing, and several forms of forcing are considered. Compressional motions are taken to be locally adiabatic ({$\gamma$} =5/3). Prior to non-linear dissipation, the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the linear theory of wave channelling in predicting the types of modes that are excited, the energy flux by carried by each mode, and the vertical wave energy distribution as a function of radius. In all cases, waves are excited that propagate on both sides of the resonance (inwards and outwards). For vertically isothermal discs, non-linear dissipation occurs primarily through shocks that result from the classical steepening of acoustic waves. For discs that are substantially thermally stratified, wave channelling is the primary mechanism for shock generation. Wave channelling boosts the Mach number of the wave by vertically confining the wave to a small cool region at the base of the disc atmosphere. In general, outwardly propagating waves with Mach numbers near resonance Mr {$>\sptilde$}0.01 undergo shocks within a distance of order the resonance radius.},

We determine the gas flow pattern, and the accretion and migration rates of the planet. The planet is assumed to be in a fixed circular orbit about the central star. It is also assumed to be able to accrete gas without expansion on the scale of its Roche radius. Only planets with masses Mp{$>\sptilde$} 0.1 MJ produce significant perturbations in the surface density of the disc. The flow within the Roche lobe of the planet is fully three-dimensional. Gas streams generally enter the Roche lobe close to the disc mid-plane, but produce much weaker shocks than the streams in two-dimensional models. The streams supply material to a circumplanetary disc that rotates in the same sense as the orbit of the planet. Much of the mass supply to the circumplanetary disc comes from non-coplanar flow. The accretion rate peaks with a planet mass of approximately 0.1 MJ and is highly efficient, occurring at the local viscous rate. The migration time-scales for planets of mass less than 0.1 MJ, based on torques from disc material outside the Roche lobes of the planets, are in excellent agreement with the linear theory of type I (non-gap) migration for three-dimensional discs. The transition from type I to type II (gap) migration is smooth, with changes in migration times of about a factor of 2. Starting with a core which can undergo runaway growth, a planet can gain up to a few MJ with little migration. Planets with final masses of the order of 10 MJ would undergo large migration, which makes formation and survival difficult.},

  abstract = {We present results from the largest numerical simulation of star formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit. The simulation follows the collapse and fragmentation of a large-scale turbulent molecular cloud to form a stellar cluster and, simultaneously, the formation of circumstellar discs and binary stars. This large range of scales enables us to predict a wide variety of stellar properties for comparison with observations. The calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a highly-dynamic and chaotic process. Star formation occurs in localized bursts within the cloud via the fragmentation both of dense molecular cloud cores and of massive circumstellar discs. Star-disc encounters form binaries and truncate discs. Stellar encounters disrupt bound multiple systems. We find that the observed statistical properties of stars are a natural consequence of star formation in such a dynamical environment. The cloud produces roughly equal numbers of stars and brown dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limit for fragmentation (\textasciitilde 5 Jupiter masses). The initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter slope ({$\Gamma$}=-1.35) above 0.5 Msolar, a roughly flat distribution ({$\Gamma$}= 0) in the range 0.006-0.5 Msolar, and a sharp cut-off below \textasciitilde 0.005 Msolar. This is consistent with recent observational surveys. The brown dwarfs form by the dynamical ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiple systems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar masses. Close binary systems (with separations {$<\sptilde$}10 au) are not formed by fragmentation in situ. Rather, they are produced by hardening of initially wider multiple systems through a combination of dynamical encounters, gas accretion, and/or the interaction with circumbinary and circumtriple discs. Finally, we find that the majority of circumstellar discs have radii less than 20 au due to truncation in dynamical encounters. This is consistent with observations of the Orion Trapezium cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do not form large planetary systems.},

The calculations follow the formation and evolution of the first hydrostatic core/disc, the collapse to form a stellar core, and effect of stellar core formation on the surrounding disc and envelope. Past barotropic calculations have shown that rapidly rotating first cores evolve into 'pre-stellar discs' with radii up to {$\sim$}100 au that may last thousands of years before a stellar core forms. We investigate how the inclusion of a realistic equation of state and radiative transfer alters this behaviour, finding that the qualitative behaviour is similar, but that the pre-stellar discs may last 1.5-3 times longer in the more realistic calculations. The masses, radii and lifetimes of the discs increase for initial molecular cloud cores with faster rotation rates. In the most extreme case we model, a pre-stellar disc with a mass of 0.22 M{$\odot$} and a radius of {$\approx$}100 au can form in a 1-M{$\odot$} cloud and last several thousand years before a stellar core is formed. Such large, massive objects may be imaged using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. Fragmentation of these massive discs may also provide an effective route to binary and multiple star formation, before radiative feedback from accretion on to the stellar core can inhibit fragmentation. Once collapse to form a stellar core occurs within the pre-stellar disc, the radiation hydrodynamical simulations produce qualitatively different behaviour from the barotropic calculations due to the accretion energy released. This drives a shockwave through the circumstellar disc and launches a bipolar outflow even in the absence of magnetic fields.},

The initial conditions are identical to those of previous barotropic calculations published by Bate, but this time the calculation is performed using a realistic equation of state and radiation hydrodynamics. The calculation uses sink particles to model 183 stars and brown dwarfs, including 28 binaries and 12 higher-order multiple systems, the properties of which are compared to the results from observational surveys. We find that the radiation hydrodynamical/sink particle simulation reproduces many observed stellar properties very well. In particular, whereas using a barotropic equation of state produces more brown dwarfs than stars, the inclusion of radiative feedback results in a stellar mass function and a ratio of brown dwarfs to stars in good agreement with observations of Galactic star-forming regions. In addition, many of the other statistical properties of the stars and brown dwarfs are in reasonable agreement with observations, including multiplicity as a function of primary mass, the frequency of very low mass binaries, and general trends for the mass ratio and separation distributions of binaries. We also examine the velocity dispersion of the stars, the distributions of disc truncation radii due to dynamical interactions, and coplanarity of orbits and sink particle spins in multiple systems. Overall, the calculation produces a cluster of stars whose statistical properties are difficult to distinguish from observed systems, implying that gravity, hydrodynamics and radiative feedback are the primary ingredients for determining the origin of the statistical properties of low-mass stars.},

We quantify the distributions of disc mass and radii for protostellar ages up to {$\approx$}105 yr. For low-mass protostars, disc masses tend to increase with both age and protostellar mass. Disc radii range from of order 10 to a few hundred au, grow in size on time-scales {$\lessequivlnt$} 104 yr, and are smaller around lower mass protostars. The radial surface density profiles of isolated protostellar discs are flatter than the minimum mass solar nebula model, typically scaling as {$\Sigma$} {$\propto$} r-1.

In this context, transition disks are prime targets because they are at an advanced stage of disk clearing and may harbor direct signatures of disk evolution. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to derive new constraints on the structure of the transition disk MWC 758, to detect non-axisymmetric features and understand their origin. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We obtained infrared polarized intensity observations of the protoplanetary disk MWC 758 with VLT/SPHERE at 1.04 {$\mu$}m to resolve scattered light at a smaller inner working angle (0.093'') and a higher angular resolution (0.027'') than previously achieved. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We observe polarized scattered light within 0.53'' (148 au) down to the inner working angle (26 au) and detect distinct non-axisymmetric features but no fully depleted cavity. The two small-scale spiral features that were previously detected with HiCIAO are resolved more clearly, and new features are identified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radii close to the star. We present a model based on the spiral density wave theory with two planetary companions in circular orbits. The best model requires a high disk aspect ratio (H/r \textasciitilde{} 0.20 at the planet locations) to account for the large pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our observations reveal the complex morphology of the disk MWC 758.

  abstract = {Context. Understanding the diversity of planets requires studying the morphology and physical conditions in the protoplanetary disks in which they form. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to study the structure of the \textasciitilde 10 Myr old protoplanetary disk HD 100453, to detect features that can trace disk evolution and to understand the mechanisms that drive these features. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We observed HD 100453 in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE at optical (0.6 {$\mu$}m, 0.8 {$\mu$}m) and near-infrared (1.2 {$\mu$}m) wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of \textasciitilde 0.02'', and an inner working angle of \textasciitilde 0.09''. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We spatially resolve the disk around HD 100453, and detect polarized scattered light up to \textasciitilde 0.42'' (\textasciitilde 48 au). We detect a cavity, a rim with azimuthal brightness variations at an inclination of \textasciitilde 38\textdegree{} with respect to our line of sight, two shadows and two symmetric spiral arms. The spiral arms originate near the location of the shadows, close to the semi major axis. We detect a faint feature in the SW that can be interpreted as the scattering surface of the bottom side of the disk, if the disk is tidally truncated by the M-dwarf companion currently seen at a projected distance of \textasciitilde 119 au. We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for the main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk misaligned by \textasciitilde 72\textdegree. The azimuthal brightness variations along the rim are well reproduced with the scattering phase function of the model. While spirals can be triggered by the tidal interaction with the companion, the close proximity of the spirals to the shadows suggests that the shadows could also play a role. The change in stellar illumination along the rim induces an azimuthal variation of the scale height that can contribute to the brightness variations. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Dark regions in polarized images of transition disks are now detected in a handful of disks and often interpreted as shadows due to a misaligned inner disk. However, the origin of such a misalignment in HD 100453, and of the spirals, is still unclear, and might be due to a yet-undetected massive companion inside the cavity, and on an inclined orbit. Observations over a few years will allow us to measure the spiral pattern speed, and determine if the shadows are fixed or moving, which may constrain their origin. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations performed with VLT/SPHERE under program ID 096.C-0248(B).},

In this review we discuss recent progress in their study, including the newly discovered IR dark clouds that are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large scales, dark clouds present filamentary mass distributions with motions dominated by supersonic turbulence. At small, subparsec scales, a population of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse of the conditions prior to stellar birth. Recent studies of starless cores reveal a combination of simple physical properties together with a complex chemical structure dominated by the freeze-out of molecules onto cold dust grains. Elucidating this combined structure is both an observational and theoretical challenge whose solution will bring us closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses to form stars.},

  abstract = {UV photochemistry in the surface layers of protoplanetary disks dramatically alters their composition relative to previous stages of star formation. The abundance ratio CN/HCN has long been proposed to trace the UV field in various astrophysical objects; however, to date the relationship between CN, HCN, and the UV field in disks remains ambiguous. As part of the ALMA Large Program MAPS (Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales), we present observations of CN N = 1-0 transitions at 0.{${''}$}3 resolution toward five disk systems. All disks show bright CN emission within \textasciitilde 50-150 au, along with a diffuse emission shelf extending up to 600 au. In all sources we find that the CN/HCN column density ratio increases with disk radius from about unity to 100, likely tracing increased UV penetration that enhances selective HCN photodissociation in the outer disk. Additionally, multiple millimeter dust gaps and rings coincide with peaks and troughs, respectively, in the CN/HCN ratio, implying that some millimeter substructures are accompanied by changes to the UV penetration in more elevated disk layers. That the CN/HCN ratio is generally high ({$>$}1) points to a robust photochemistry shaping disk chemical compositions and also means that CN is the dominant carrier of the prebiotically interesting nitrile group at most disk radii. We also find that the local column densities of CN and HCN are positively correlated despite emitting from vertically stratified disk regions, indicating that different disk layers are chemically linked. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.},

  abstract = {Observations of circumstellar environments that look for the direct signal of exoplanets and the scattered light from disks have significant instrumental implications. In the past 15 years, major developments in adaptive optics, coronagraphy, optical manufacturing, wavefront sensing, and data processing, together with a consistent global system analysis have brought about a new generation of high-contrast imagers and spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes with much better performance. One of the most productive imagers is the Spectro-Polarimetic High contrast imager for Exoplanets REsearch (SPHERE), which was designed and built for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. SPHERE includes an extreme adaptive optics system, a highly stable common path interface, several types of coronagraphs, and three science instruments. Two of them, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and the Infra-Red Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), were designed to efficiently cover the near-infrared range in a single observation for an efficient search of young planets. The third instrument, ZIMPOL, was designed for visible polarimetric observation to look for the reflected light of exoplanets and the light scattered by debris disks. These three scientific instruments enable the study of circumstellar environments at unprecedented angular resolution, both in the visible and the near-infrared. In this work, we thoroughly present SPHERE and its on-sky performance after four years of operations at the VLT.},

In the coming years, many more disks will be mapped with ALMA at similar resolution. Interpreting the results in terms of the properties and quantities of the emitting dusty material is, however, a very non-trivial task. This is in part due to the uncertainty in the dust opacities, an uncertainty that is not likely to be resolved any time soon. It is also partly due to the fact that, as the DSHARP survey has shown, these disk often contain regions of intermediate to high optical depth, even at millimeter wavelengths and at relatively large radius in the disk. This makes the interpretation challenging, in particular if the grains are large and have a large albedo. On the other hand, the highly structured features seen in the DSHARP survey, of which strong indications were already seen in earlier observations, provide a unique opportunity to study the dust growth and dynamics. To provide continuity within the DSHARP project, its follow-up projects, and projects by other teams interested in these data, we present here the methods and opacity choices used within the DSHARP collaboration to link the measured intensity I {$\nu$} to dust surface density {$\Sigma$} d .},

  abstract = {The formation of planets with gaseous envelopes takes place in protoplanetary accretion discs on time scales of several million years. Small dust particles stick to each other to form pebbles, pebbles concentrate in the turbulent flow to form planetesimals and planetary embryos and grow to planets, which undergo substantial radial migration. All these processes are influenced by the underlying structure of the protoplanetary disc, specifically the profiles of temperature, gas scale height, and density. The commonly used disc structure of the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) is a simple power law in all these quantities. However, protoplanetary disc models with both viscous and stellar heating show several bumps and dips in temperature, scale height, and density caused by transitions in opacity, which are missing in the MMSN model. These play an important role in the formation of planets, since they can act as sweet spots for forming planetesimals via the streaming instability and affect the direction and magnitude of type-I migration. We present 2D simulations of accretion discs that feature radiative cooling and viscous and stellar heating, and they are linked to the observed evolutionary stages of protoplanetary discs and their host stars. These models allow us to identify preferred planetesimal and planet formation regions in the protoplanetary disc as a function of the disc's metallicity, accretion rate, and lifetime. We derive simple fitting formulae that feature all structural characteristics of protoplanetary discs during the evolution of several Myr. These fits are straightforward for applying to modelling any growth stage of planets where detailed knowledge of the underlying disc structure is required. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424964/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

The dust continuum emission is characterized by a large cavity of roughly 40 au in radius which might contain a mildly inner warped disk. The outer disk features two bright emission clumps at radii of {$\sim$}47 and 82 au that present azimuthal extensions and form a double-ring structure. The comparison with radiative transfer models indicates that these two maxima of emission correspond to local increases in the dust surface density of about a factor 2.5 and 6.5 for the south and north clumps, respectively. The optically thick 13CO peak emission, which traces the temperature, and the dust continuum emission, which probes the disk midplane, additionally reveal two spirals previously detected in near-IR at the disk surface.

  abstract = {I argue for two modes of gas giant planet formation and discuss the conditions under which each mode operates. Gas giant planets at disk radii r{$>$}100 AU are likely to form in situ by disk instability, while core accretion plus gas capture remains the dominant formation mechanism for r {$<$} 100 AU. During the mass accretion phase, mass loading can push disks toward fragmentation conditions at large r. Massive, extended disks can fragment into clumps of a few to tens of Jupiter masses. This is confirmed by radiation hydrodynamics simulations. The two modes of gas giant formation should lead to a bimodal distribution of gas giant semimajor axes. Because core accretion is expected to be less efficient in low-metallicity systems, the ratio of gas giants at large r to planets at small r should increase with decreasing metallicity.},

Gravitational perturbations from a planet produce peculiar 'kinks' in channel maps of different gas species. In this paper, we show that such kinks can be reproduced using semi-analytic models for the velocity perturbation induced by a planet. In doing so we (i) confirm that the observed kinks are consistent with the planet-induced wake; (ii) show how to quantify the planet mass from the kink amplitude; in particular, we show that the kink amplitude scales with the square root of the planet mass for channels far from the planet velocity, steepening to linear as the channels approach the planet; and (iii) show how to extend the theory to include the effect of damping, which may be needed in order to have localized kinks.},

  abstract = {During the main phase of evolution of a protoplanetary disk, accretion regulates the inner-disk properties, such as the temperature and mass distribution, and in turn, the physical conditions associated with planet formation. The driving mechanism behind accretion remains uncertain; however, one promising mechanism is the removal of a fraction of angular momentum via a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind launched from the inner tens of astronomical units of the disk. This paper utilizes CO isotopologue emission to study the unique molecular outflow originating from the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. HD 163296 is one of the most well-studied Class II disks and is proposed to host multiple gas-giant planets. We robustly detect the large-scale rotating outflow in the 12CO J = 2 - 1 and the 13CO J = 2 - 1 and J = 1 - 0 transitions. We constrain the kinematics, the excitation temperature of the molecular gas, and the mass-loss rate. The high ratio of the rates of ejection to accretion (5-50), together with the rotation signatures of the flow, provides solid evidence for an MHD disk wind. We find that the angular momentum removal by the wind is sufficient to drive accretion though the inner region of the disk; therefore, accretion driven by turbulent viscosity is not required to explain HD 163296's accretion. The low temperature of the molecular wind and its overall kinematics suggest that the MHD disk wind could be perturbed and shocked by the previously observed high-velocity atomic jet.

  abstract = {The elemental composition of the gas and dust in a protoplanetary disk influences the compositions of the planets that form in it. We use the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) data to constrain the elemental composition of the gas at the locations of potentially forming planets. The elemental abundances are inferred by comparing source-specific gas-grain thermochemical models with variable C/O ratios and small-grain abundances from the DALI code with CO and C2H column densities derived from the high-resolution observations of the disks of AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. Elevated C/O ratios (\textasciitilde 2.0), even within the CO ice line, are necessary to match the inferred C2H column densities over most of the pebble disk. Combined with constraints on the CO abundances in these systems, this implies that both the O/H and C/H ratios in the gas are substellar by a factor of 4-10, with the O/H depleted by a factor of 20-50, resulting in the high C/O ratios. This necessitates that even within the CO ice line, most of the volatile carbon and oxygen is still trapped on grains in the midplane. Planets accreting gas in the gaps of the AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480 disks will thus acquire very little carbon and oxygen after reaching the pebble isolation mass. In the absence of atmosphere-enriching events, these planets would thus have a strongly substellar O/H and C/H and superstellar C/O atmospheric composition.

  abstract = {Constraining the distribution of gas and dust in the inner 20 au of protoplanetary disks is difficult. At the same time, this region is thought to be responsible for most planet formation, especially around the water ice line at 3-10 au. Under the assumption that the gas is in a Keplerian disk, we use the exquisite sensitivity of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA large program to construct radial surface brightness profiles with a \textasciitilde 3 au effective resolution for the CO isotopologue J = 2-1 lines using the line velocity profile. IM Lup reveals a central depression in 13CO and C18O that is ascribed to a pileup of \textasciitilde 500 M{$\oplus$} of dust in the inner 20 au, leading to a gas-to-dust ratio of around {$<$}10. This pileup is consistent with an efficient drift of grains ({$\greaterequivlnt$}100 M{$\oplus$} Myr-1) and a local gas-to-dust ratio that suggests that the streaming instability could be active. The CO isotopologue emission in the GM Aur disk is consistent with a small (\textasciitilde 15 au), strongly depleted gas cavity within the \textasciitilde 40 au dust cavity. The radial surface brightness profiles for both the AS 209 and HD 163296 disks show a local minimum and maximum in the C18O emission at the location of a known dust ring (\textasciitilde 14 au) and gap (\textasciitilde 10 au), respectively. This indicates that the dust ring has a low gas-to-dust ratio ({$>$}10) and that the dust gap is gas-rich enough to have optically thick C18O.

  abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of protostellar accretion disks that are perturbed by a protoplanetary companion that has a much smaller mass than the central object. We consider the limiting cases where the companion is in a coplanar, circular orbit and is initially embedded in the disk. Three independent numerical schemes are employed, and generic features of the flow are found in each case. In the first series of idealized models, the secondary companion is modeled as a massless, orbiting sink hole able to absorb all matter incident upon it without exerting any gravitational torque on the disk. In these simulations, accretion onto the companion induces surface density depression and gap formation centered on its orbital radius. After an initial transitory adjustment, the accretion rate onto the sink hole becomes regulated by the rate at which viscous evolution of the disk can cause matter to diffuse into the vicinity of the sink hole orbit, and thus the sink hole grows on a disk viscous timescale. In the second series of comprehensive models, the companion's gravity is included. When the tidal torque exerted by the companion on the disk becomes important, the angular momentum exchange rate between the companion and the disk induces the protoplanetary accretion to reduce markedly below that in the idealized sink hole models. Whether this process is effective in inhibiting protoplanetary accretion depends on the equation of state and disk model parameters. For polytropic or isothermal equations of state, we find, in basic agreement with earlier work, that when the mean Roche lobe radius of the companion exceeds the disk thickness and when the mass ratio, q, between the companion and the central object exceeds \textasciitilde 40/\textbackslash Rscr, where \textbackslash Rscr is the effective Reynolds number, a clean deep gap forms. Although precise estimation is rendered difficult due to the limitation of numerical schemes in dealing with large density contrasts, the generic results of three series of simulations indicate that accretion onto sufficiently massive protoplanets can become ineffective over the expected disk lifetimes in their neighborhood. We suggest that such a process operates during planetary formation and is important in determining the final mass of giant planets.},

  abstract = {Understanding the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks is key to interpreting observations, predicting the physical and chemical evolution of the disk, and modeling planet formation processes. In this study, we constrain the two-dimensional thermal structure of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. Using the thermochemical code RAC2D, we derive a thermal structure that reproduces spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations (\textasciitilde 0"12 (13 au)-0"25 (26 au)) of 12CO J = 2 - 1, 13CO J = 1 - 0, 2 - 1, C18O J = 1 - 0, 2 - 1, and C17O J = 1 - 0, the HD J = 1 - 0 flux upper limit, the spectral energy distribution (SED), and continuum morphology. The final model incorporates both a radial depletion of CO motivated by a timescale shorter than typical CO gas-phase chemistry (0.01 Myr) and an enhanced temperature near the surface layer of the the inner disk (z/r {$\geq$} 0.21). This model agrees with the majority of the empirically derived temperatures and observed emitting surfaces derived from the J = 2 - 1 CO observations. We find an upper limit for the disk mass of 0.35 M{$\odot$}, using the upper limit of the HD J = 1 - 0 and J = 2 - 1 flux. With our final thermal structure, we explore the impact that gaps have on the temperature structure constrained by observations of the resolved gaps. Adding a large gap in the gas and small dust additionally increases gas temperature in the gap by only 5\%-10\%.

The inner companion hypothesis is found to explain the double spiral arms, as well as several additional features seen in MWC 758 - the arc in the north-west, substructures inside the spiral arms, the cavity in CO isotopologues, and the twist in the kinematics. Testable predictions include detection of fainter spiral structure, detection of a point source south-southeast of the primary, and proper motion of the spiral arms.},

The distribution of the extinction in the clouds leads to estimate their total individual masses M and their maximum of extinction. I show that the relation between the mass contained within an iso-extinction contour and the extinction is similar from cloud to cloud and allows the extrapolation of the maximum of extinction in the range 5.7 to 25.5 magnitudes. I found that about half of the mass is contained in regions where the visual extinction is smaller than 1 magnitude. The star count method used on large scale ( \textasciitilde{} 250 square degrees) is a powerful and relatively straightforward method to estimate the mass of molecular complexes.

  abstract = {Protoplanets and circumplanetary disks are rather elusive in their thermal IR emission. Yet they are cornerstones to the most popular interpretations for the protoplanetary disk structures observed in the gas and dust density fields, even though alternative theories exist. The gaseous velocity field should also bear the imprint of planet-disk interactions, with non-Keplerian fine structure in the molecular-line channel maps. Such kinks or wiggles are affected by the optical depth structure and synthesis imaging limitations, but their detail could in principle be connected to the perturber by comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. These predictions appear to have been observed in HD 163296 and HD 97048, where the most conspicuous wiggles are interpreted in terms of embedded planets. The velocity centroid maps may allow for more robust indirect detections of embedded planets. The non-Keplerian velocity along the planetary wakes undergoes an abrupt sign reversal across the protoplanet. After subtraction of the disk rotation curve, the location of the perturber should be identifiable as a Doppler flip in velocity centroid maps. Here we improve our rotation curves in an extension to disks with intermediate inclinations, which we apply to deep and fine angular resolution CO isotopologue data sets. Trials in HD 163296 and in HD 97048 yield nondetections. However, in HD 100546 we pick up a conspicuous Doppler flip, an important part of which is likely due to radial flows. Its coincidence with a fine ridge crossing an annular groove inside the continuum ring suggests a complex dynamical scenario, in which the putative protoplanet might have recently undergone pebble accretion.},

  abstract = {Deuterium fractionation is dependent on various physical and chemical parameters. Thus, the formation location and thermal history of material in the solar system is often studied by measuring its D/H ratio. This requires knowledge about the deuteration processes operating during the planet formation era. We aim to study these processes by radially resolving the DCN/HCN (at 0"3 resolution) and N2D+/N2H+ (\textasciitilde 0"3-0"9) column density ratios toward the five protoplanetary disks observed by the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming scales (MAPS) Large Program. DCN is detected in all five sources, with one newly reported detection. N2D+ is detected in four sources, two of which are newly reported detections. We derive column density profiles that allow us to study the spatial variation of the DCN/HCN and N2D+/N2H+ ratios at high resolution. DCN/HCN varies considerably for different parts of the disks, ranging from 10-3 to 10-1. In particular, the inner-disk regions generally show significantly lower HCN deuteration compared with the outer disk. In addition, our analysis confirms that two deuterium fractionation channels are active, which can alter the D/H ratio within the pool of organic molecules. N2D+ is found in the cold outer regions beyond \textasciitilde 50 au, with N2D+/N2H+ ranging between 10-2 and 1 across the disk sample. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation that N2H+ deuteration proceeds via the low-temperature channel only. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the thermal torques exerted on low-mass planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary discs with thermal diffusion, by means of high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. We confirm that thermal torques essentially depend on the offset between the planet and its corotation, and find a good agreement with analytic estimates when this offset is small compared to the size of the thermal disturbance. For larger offsets that may be attained in discs with a large pressure gradient or a small thermal diffusivity, thermal torques tend towards an asymptotic value broadly compatible with results from a dynamical friction calculation in an unsheared medium. We perform a convergence study and find that the thermal disturbance must be resolved over typically 10 zones for a decent agreement with analytic predictions. We find that the luminosity at which the net thermal torque changes sign matches that predicted by linear theory within a few percents. Our study confirms that thermal torques usually supersede Lindblad and corotation torques by almost an order of magnitude for low-mass planets. As we increase the planetary mass, we find that the ratio of thermal torques to Lindblad and corotation torques is progressively reduced, and that the thermal disturbance is increasingly distorted by the horseshoe flow. Overall, we find that thermal torques are dominant for masses up to an order of magnitude larger than implemented in recent models of planetary population synthesis. We finally briefly discuss the case of stellar or intermediate-mass objects embedded in discs around active galactic nuclei.},

We explore how the disc structure changes due to planet-induced perturbations and also how the appearance of vortices affects planet migration. We use multifluid 2D hydrodynamical simulations and the dust is treated in the pressureless-fluid approximation, assuming a single grain size of \$5\textbackslash, \textbackslash mu \{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\}\$. The initial surface density profiles containing two bumps are motivated by recent observations of the protoplanetary disc HD163296. When planets are allowed to migrate, either a single planet from the outer pressure maximum or two planets from each pressure maximum, the initial pressure bumps quickly spread and merge into a single bump which is radially wide and has a very low amplitude. The redistribution of the disc material is accompanied by the Rossby Wave Instability and an appearance of mini-vortices that merge in a short period of time to form a large vortex. The large vortex induces perturbations with a spiral wave pattern that propagate away from the vortex as density waves. We found that these vortex-induced spiral waves strongly interact with the spiral waves generated by the planet and we called this mechanism the 'Faraway Interaction'. It facilitates much slower and/or stagnant migration of the planets and it excites their orbital eccentricities in some cases. Our study provides a new explanation for how rocky planets can come to have a slow migration in protoplanetary discs where vortex formation occurs.},

As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the spectral energy distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than an order of magnitude greater radius.

This paper focuses on the morphology of the outer disk through ALMA observations of \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=2-1, \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=3-2 and \$\^\{13\}\$CO J=2-1. Both \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=2-1 and \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=3-2 show spiral features of different sizes. The innermost spiral arm (S1) is a radio counterpart of the first near-infrared spiral observed by Fukagawa et al. (2006), but it is shifted radially outward. However, the most conspicuous CO spiral arm (S2) lies at the outskirts of the disk and had not been detected before. It corresponds to a cold density structure, with both brightness and excitation temperatures of order 13\$\textbackslash pm\$2 K and conspicuous in the \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=2-1 peak-intensity map, but faint in \$\^\{12\}\$CO J=3-2. There is also a faint counterarm (S3), point-symmetrical of S2 with respect to the star. These three spirals are modelled separately with two different formulae that approximate the loci of density maxima in acoustic waves due to embedded planets. S1 could be fit relatively well with these formulae, compared to S2 and S3. Alternative scenarios such as gravitational instability or external tidal interaction are discussed. The impact of channelization on spectrally and spatially resolved peak intensity maps is also briefly addressed.},

Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2 arcsec (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. 60 of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in eight of the sources and hints of such structures in another four discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform preliminary comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only {$\sim$}50 discs ({$\sim$}1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M{$\oplus$} core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained.

We explore the performance of a semi-analytical framework for describing the non-linear evolution of the global planet-driven density waves, focusing on the low planet mass regime (below the so-called thermal mass). We show that this framework accurately captures the (quasi-)self-similar evolution of the wave properties expressed in terms of properly rescaled variables, provided that certain theoretical inputs are calibrated using numerical simulations (an approximate, first principles calculation of the wave evolution based on the inviscid Burgers equation is in qualitative agreement with simulations but overpredicts wave damping at the quantitative level). We provide fitting formulae for such inputs, in particular, the strength and global shape of the planet-driven shock accounting for non-linear effects. We use this non-linear framework to theoretically compute vortensity production in the disc by the global spiral shock and numerically verify the accuracy of this calculation. Our results can be used for interpreting observations of spiral features in discs, kinematic signatures of embedded planets in CO line emission ('kinks'), and for understanding the emergence of planet-driven vortices in protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {In this paper we perform a systematic analysis of the structure induced by the onset of gravitational instabilities in cooling gaseous accretion discs. It is well known that for low enough cooling rates the disc reaches a quasi-steady configuration, with the instability saturating at a finite amplitude such that the disc is kept close to marginal stability. We analyse the dependence of the saturation amplitude on the imposed cooling rate, and we find that it scales with the inverse square root of the cooling parameter {$\beta$} = tcool/tdyn. This indicates that the heating rate induced by the instability is proportional to the energy density of the density waves excited by the disc self-gravity. In particular, we find that at saturation the energy dissipated per dynamical time by weak shocks due to the gravitational perturbations is of the order of 20 per cent of the wave energy. We further perform a Fourier analysis of the disc structure, and subsequently determine the dominant radial and azimuthal wavenumbers of the density waves. While the number of spiral arms (corresponding to the azimuthal wavenumber) is fairly constant with radius, we find that the disc displays a range of radial wavenumbers whose mean increases with increasing radius. The dominant modes closely match the locally most unstable wavelength as predicted by linear perturbation analysis. As a consequence, we numerically demonstrate that the density waves excited in relatively low-mass discs Mdisc/M* \textasciitilde{} 0.1 are always close to corotation, deviating from it by approximately 10 per cent. This result can be understood in terms of the constancy of the Doppler-shifted phase Mach number of the flow - the pattern speed self-adjusts so that the flow into spiral arms is always sonic. This has profound effects on the degree to which the extraction of energy and angular momentum from the mean flow through density waves can be modelled as a viscous process. Our results thus provide (i) a detailed description of how the self-regulation mechanism is established for low cooling rates, (ii) a clarification of the conditions required for describing the transport induced by self-gravity through an effective viscosity, (iii) an estimate of the maximum amplitude of the density perturbation before fragmentation takes place and finally (iv) a simple recipe to estimate the density perturbation in different thermal regimes.},

The simplest approach, which is based upon the balance between the torques due to the viscosity and the gravity of the planet and assumes local damping, leads to gaps with overestimated width, especially at low viscosity. Here, we take into account the fraction of the gravity torque that is evacuated by pressure supported waves. With a novel approach, which consists of following the fluid elements along their trajectories, we show that the flux of angular momentum carried by the waves corresponds to a pressure torque. The equilibrium profile of the disk is then set by the balance between gravity, viscous and pressure torques. We check that this balance is satisfied in numerical simulations, with a planet on a fixed circular orbit. We then use a reference numerical simulation to get an ansatz for the pressure torque, that yields gap profiles for any value of the disk viscosity, pressure scale height and planet to primary mass ratio. Those are in good agreement with profiles obtained in numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. Finally, we provide a gap opening criterion that simultaneously involves the planet mass, the disk viscosity and the aspect ratio.},

Exploring different orbital inclinations, periastron distances, and mass ratios, we investigate the disc dynamical response during and after the flyby. We find that flybys induce evolving spiral structure in both gas and dust that can persist for thousands of years after periastron. Gas and dust structures induced by the flyby differ because of drag-induced effects on the dust grains. Variations in the accretion rate by up to an order of magnitude occur over a time-scale of the order of 10 yr or less, inducing FU Orionis-like outbursts. The remnant discs are truncated and warped. The dust disc is left more compact than the gas disc, both because of disc truncation and accelerated radial drift of grains induced by the flyby.},

  abstract = {Tidal encounters in star clusters perturb discs around young protostars. In Cuello et al., we detailed the dynamical signatures of a stellar flyby in both gas and dust. Flybys produce warped discs, spirals with evolving pitch angles, increasing accretion rates, and disc truncation. Here, we present the corresponding observational signatures of these features in optical/near-infrared scattered light and (sub) millimetre continuum and CO line emission. Using representative prograde and retrograde encounters for direct comparison, we post-process hydrodynamical simulations with radiative transfer methods to generate a catalogue of multiwavelength observations. This provides a reference to identify flybys in recent near-infrared and submillimetre observations (e.g. RW Aur, AS 205, HV Tau and DO Tau, FU Ori, V2775 Ori, and Z CMa).},

  abstract = {Two studies utilizing sparse aperture-masking (SAM) interferometry and H {$\alpha$} differential imaging have reported multiple Jovian companions around the young solar-mass star, LkCa 15 (LkCa 15 bcd): the first claimed direct detection of infant, newly formed planets (``protoplanets''). We present new near-infrared direct imaging/spectroscopy from the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system coupled with Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) integral field spectrograph and multi-epoch thermal infrared imaging from Keck/NIRC2 of LkCa 15 at high Strehl ratios. These data provide the first direct imaging look at the same wavelengths and in the same locations where previous studies identified the LkCa 15 protoplanets, and thus offer the first decisive test of their existence. The data do not reveal these planets. Instead, we resolve extended emission tracing a dust disk with a brightness and location comparable to that claimed for LkCa 15 bcd. Forward-models attributing this signal to orbiting planets are inconsistent with the combined SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2 data. An inner disk provides a more compelling explanation for the SAM detections and perhaps also the claimed H {$\alpha$} detection of LkCa 15 b. We conclude that there is currently no clear, direct evidence for multiple protoplanets orbiting LkCa 15, although the system likely contains at least one unseen Jovian companion. To identify Jovian companions around LkCa 15 from future observations, the inner disk should be detected and its effect modeled, removed, and shown to be distinguishable from planets. Protoplanet candidates identified from similar systems should likewise be clearly distinguished from disk emission through modeling.},

With at least one clump-like protoplanet and multiple spiral arms, the AB Aur system may also provide the evidence for a long-considered alternative to the canonical model for Jupiter's formation, namely disk (gravitational) instability.},

  abstract = {The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales Large Program (MAPS LP) surveyed the chemical structures of five protoplanetary disks across more than 40 different spectral lines at high angular resolution (0"15 and 0"30 beams for Bands 6 and 3, respectively) and sensitivity (spanning 0.3-1.3 mJy beam-1 and 0.4-1.9 mJy beam-1 for Bands 6 and 3, respectively). In this article, we describe the multistage workflow-built around the CASA tclean image deconvolution procedure-that we used to generate the core data product of the MAPS LP: the position-position-velocity image cubes for each spectral line. Owing to the expansive nature of the survey, we encountered a range of imaging challenges: some are familiar to the submillimeter protoplanetary disk community, like the need to use an accurate CLEAN mask, and others are less well known, like the incorrect default flux scaling of the CLEAN residual map first described by Jorsater \& van Moorsel (the "JvM effect"). We distill lessons learned into recommended workflows for synthesizing image cubes of molecular emission. In particular, we describe how to produce image cubes with accurate fluxes via "JvM correction," a procedure that is generally applicable to any image synthesized via CLEAN deconvolution but is especially critical for low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) emission. We further explain how we used visibility tapering to promote a common, fiducial beam size and contextualize the interpretation of S/N when detecting molecular emission from protoplanetary disks.

Cabrit et al. noted the resemblance between this extended structure and the tidal arm stripped from the primary star in the simulations of star-disc encounters by Clarke \& Pringle. In this paper, we use new hydrodynamical models and synthetic observations to fit many of the parameters of RW Aur. Using hydrodynamic models, we find that the morphological appearance of RW Aur can be indeed explained by a tidal encounter with the secondary star. We reproduce all the major morphological and kinematic features of the system. Using radiative transfer calculations, we find that synthetic CO and dust continuum observations of our hydrodynamic models agree well with observations. We reproduce all the main features of the line profiles, from emission fluxes to the optical depth of the different components of the system. The agreement between observations and simulations thus lends strong support to the hypothesis of a tidal encounter scenario. Finally, we propose a possible solution for the origin of the dimming of the primary star observed in 2010/2011 by Rodriguez et al.},

  abstract = {Context. Detecting and characterising exoworlds around very young stars (age {$\leq$}10 Myr) are key aspects of exoplanet demographic studies, especially for understanding the mechanisms and timescales of planet formation and migration. Any reliable theory for such physical phenomena requires a robust observational database to be tested. However, detection using the radial velocity method alone can be very challenging because the amplitude of the signals caused by the magnetic activity of such stars can be orders of magnitude larger than those induced even by massive planets. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We observed the very young (\textasciitilde 2 Myr) and very active star V830 Tau with the HARPS-N spectrograph between October 2017 and March 2020 to independently confirm and characterise the previously reported hot Jupiter V830 Tau b (K\textsubscript{b} = 68 {$\pm$} 11 m s\textsuperscript{-1}; m\textsubscript{b} sin i\textsubscript{b} = 0.57 {$\pm$} 0.10 M\textsubscript{Jup}; P\textsubscript{b} = 4.927 {$\pm$} 0.008 d). {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: Because of the observed \textasciitilde 1 km s\textsuperscript{-1} radial velocity scatter that can clearly be attributed to the magnetic activity of V830 Tau, we analysed radial velocities extracted with different pipelines and modelled them using several state-of-the-art tools. We devised injection-recovery simulations to support our results and characterise our detection limits. The analysis of the radial velocities was aided by a characterisation of the stellar activity using simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Despite the high quality of our HARPS-N data and the diversity of tests we performed, we were unable to detect the planet V830 Tau b in our data and cannot confirm its existence. Our simulations show that a statistically significant detection of the claimed planetary Doppler signal is very challenging. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: It is important to continue Doppler searches for planets around young stars, but utmost care must be taken in the attempt to overcome the technical difficulties to be faced in order to achieve their detection and characterisation. This point must be kept in mind when assessing their occurrence rate, formation mechanisms, and migration pathways, especially without evidence of their existence from photometric transits. {$<$}P /{$>$}Full Tables A.1, A.2, B.1, and C.1 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A133"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A133{$<$}/A{$>$} {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations made with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma by the Fundaci\'on Galileo Galilei of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the IAC.},

  abstract = {Theories of the formation and early evolution of planetary systems postulate that planets are born in circumstellar disks, and undergo radial migration during and after dissipation of the dust and gas disk from which they formed. The precise ages of meteorites indicate that planetesimals\textemdash the building blocks of planets\textemdash are produced within the first million years of a star's life. Fully formed planets are frequently detected on short orbital periods around mature stars. Some theories suggest that the in situ formation of planets close to their host stars is unlikely and that the existence of such planets is therefore evidence of large-scale migration. Other theories posit that planet assembly at small orbital separations may be common. Here we report a newly born, transiting planet orbiting its star with a period of 5.4 days. The planet is 50 per cent larger than Neptune, and its mass is less than 3.6 times that of Jupiter (at 99.7 per cent confidence), with a true mass likely to be similar to that of Neptune. The star is 5-10 million years old and has a tenuous dust disk extending outward from about twice the Earth-Sun separation, in addition to the fully formed planet located at less than one-twentieth of the Earth-Sun separation.},

The gaseous disk is more than two times larger than the dust disk, with a similar critical radius but with a shallower radial profile. Radiative transfer models of the continuum data confirm the need for a sharp outer edge to the dust disk.

  abstract = {Among the potential milliHz gravitational wave (GW) sources for the upcoming space-based interferometer LISA are extreme- or intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (EMRI/IMRIs). These events involve the coalescence of supermassive black holes in the mass range 105M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} M {$\lessequivlnt$} 107M{$\odot$} with companion BHs of much lower masses. A subset of E/IMRIs are expected to occur in the accretion discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where torques exerted by the disc can interfere with the inspiral and cause a phase shift in the GW waveform. Here we use a suite of 2D hydrodynamical simulations with the moving-mesh code DISCO to present a systematic study of disc torques. We measure torques on an inspiralling BH and compute the corresponding waveform deviations as a function of the binary mass ratio q {$\equiv$} M2/M1, the disc viscosity ({$\alpha$}), and gas temperature (or equivalently Mach number; \$\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\$). We find that the absolute value of the gas torques is within an order of magnitude of previously determined planetary migration torques, but their precise value and sign depends non-trivially on the combination of these parameters. The gas imprint is detectable by LISA for binaries embedded in AGN discs with surface densities above \$\textbackslash Sigma \_0\textbackslash ge 10\^\{4-6\} \textbackslash rm \textbackslash, g cm\^\{-2\}\$, depending on q, {$\alpha$}, and \$\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\$. Deviations are most pronounced in discs with higher viscosities, and for E/IMRIs detected at frequencies where LISA is most sensitive. Torques in colder discs exhibit a noticeable dependence on the GW-driven inspiral rate as well as strong fluctuations at late stages of the inspiral. Our results further suggest that LISA may be able to place constraints on AGN disc parameters and the physics of disc-satellite interaction.},

We aim at quantifying the impact of stellar spots on stars with various spectral types and rotational velocities and comparing the simulations with data obtained with the HARPS spectrograph. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Methods: We have developed detailed simulations of stellar spots and estimated their effects on a number of observables commonly used in the analysis of radial-velocity data when looking for extrasolar planets, such as radial-velocity curves, cross-correlation functions, bisector velocity spans, and photometric curves. Stellar and spot properties are taken into account, as well as the characteristics of the spectrograph used (generally HARPS). The computed stellar spectra are then analyzed in the same way as when searching for exoplanets. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Results: 1) A first grid of simulation results (radial-velocity amplitudes, bisector velocity-span amplitudes and shapes, and photometry) is built for F-K type stars, with different stellar and spot properties. 2) It is shown quantitatively that star spots with typical sizes of 1\% can mimic both radial-velocity curves and the bisector behavior of short-period giant planets around G-K type stars with a v sin\{i\} lower than the spectrograph resolution. For stars with intermediate v sin\{i\}, smaller spots may produce similar features. Such spots may complicate the search for low-mass planets on short-period orbits. In these cases, additional observables (e.g., photometry, spectroscopic diagnostics) are mandatory to confirm the presence of short-period planets. We discuss these possibilities and show that, in some cases, photometric variations may not be enough to clearly rule out spots as explanations of the observed radial-velocity variations. This is particularly important when searching for super-Earth planets. 3) It is also stressed that quantitative values obtained for radial-velocity and bisector velocity-span amplitudes depend strongly on the detailed star properties, on the spectrograph used, on the line or set of lines used, and on the way they are measured. High-resolution spectrographs will help in distinguishing between spots and planets. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations made with the ESO/HARPS spectrograph at the 3.6 m telescope, La Silla.},

  abstract = {We identify two distinct physical mechanisms for dust gap opening by embedded planets in protoplanetary discs based on the symmetry of the drag-induced motion around the planet: (I) a mechanism where low-mass planets, that do not disturb the gas, open gaps in dust by tidal torques assisted by drag in the inner disc, but resisted by drag in the outer disc; and (II) the usual, drag-assisted, mechanism where higher mass planets create pressure maxima in the gas disc, which the drag torque then acts to evacuate further in the dust. The first mechanism produces gaps in dust but not gas, while the second produces partial or total gas gaps which are deeper in the dust phase. Dust gaps do not necessarily indicate gas gaps.},

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 2 observations of the 1.3-mm dust continuum emission of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star Elias 24 with an angular resolution of {$\sim$}0.2 arcsec ({$\sim$}28 au). The dust continuum emission map reveals a dark ring at a radial distance of 0.47 arcsec ({$\sim$}65 au) from the central star, surrounded by a bright ring at 0.58 arcsec ({$\sim$}81 au). In the outer disc, the radial intensity profile shows two inflection points at 0.71 and 0.87 arcsec ({$\sim$}99 and 121 au, respectively). We perform global three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic gas/dust simulations of discs hosting a migrating and accreting planet. Combining the dust density maps of small and large grains with three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we produce synthetic ALMA observations of a variety of disc models in order to reproduce the gap- and ring-like features observed in Elias 24. We find that the dust emission across the disc is consistent with the presence of an embedded planet with a mass of {$\sim$}0.7 MJ at an orbital radius of {$\sim$} 60 au. Our model suggests that the two inflection points in the radial intensity profile are due to the inward radial motion of large dust grains from the outer disc. The surface brightness map of our disc model provides a reasonable match to the gap- and ring-like structures observed in Elias 24, with an average discrepancy of {$\sim$}5 per cent of the observed fluxes around the gap region.},

  abstract = {A stunning range of substructures in the dust of protoplanetary disks is routinely observed across a range of wavelengths. These gaps, rings and spirals are highly indicative of a population of unseen planets, hinting at the possibility of current observational facilities being able to capture planet-formation in action. Over the last decade, our understanding of the influence of a young planet on the dynamical structure of its parental disk has progressed significantly, revealing a host of potentially observable features which would betray the presence of a deeply embedded planet. In concert, recent observations have shown that subtle perturbations in the kinematic structure of protoplanetary disks are found in multiple sources, potentially the characteristic disturbances associated with embedded planets. In this work, we review the theoretical background of planet-disk interactions, focusing on the kinematical features, and the current methodologies used to observe these interactions in spatially and spectrally resolved observations. We discuss the potential pit falls of such kinematical detections of planets, providing best-practices for imaging and analysing interferometric data, along with a set of criteria to use as a benchmark for any claimed detection of embedded planets. We finish with a discussion on the current state of simulations in regard to planet-disk interactions, highlighting areas of particular interest and future directions which will provide the most significant impact in our search for embedded planets. This work is the culmination of the 'Visualizing the Kinematics of Planet Formation' workshop, held in October 2019 at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City.},

At {$\simeq$}3 Myr, both stars dissipated their discs recently and are interesting objects for probing star and planet formation. Profile distortions and Zeeman signatures are detected in the unpolarized and circularly polarized lines, whose rotational modulation we modelled using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps for both stars. We find that the large-scale magnetic fields of V819 Tau and V830 Tau are mostly poloidal and can be approximated at large radii by 350-400 G dipoles tilted at {$\simeq$}30\textdegree{} to the rotation axis. They are significantly weaker than the field of GQ Lup, an accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) with similar mass and age which can be used to compare the magnetic properties of wTTSs and cTTSs. The reconstructed brightness maps of both stars include cool spots and warm plages. Surface differential rotation is small, typically {$\simeq$}4.4 times smaller than on the Sun, in agreement with previous results on wTTSs. Using our Doppler images to model the activity jitter and filter it out from the radial velocity (RV) curves, we obtain RV residuals with dispersions of 0.033 and 0.104 km s-1 for V819 Tau and V830 Tau, respectively. RV residuals suggest that a hot Jupiter may be orbiting V830 Tau, though additional data are needed to confirm this preliminary result. We find no evidence for close-in giant planet around V819 Tau.},

Our data unambiguously show that CI Tau has a rotation period of 9.0 d, and that it hosts a strong, mainly poloidal large-scale field. Accretion at the surface of the star concentrates within a bright high-latitude chromospheric region that spatially overlaps with a large dark photospheric spot, in which the radial magnetic field reaches -3.7 kG. With a polar strength of -1.7 kG, the dipole component of the large-scale field is able to evacuate the central regions of the disc up to about 50 per cent of the co-rotation radius (at which the Keplerian orbital period equals the stellar rotation period) throughout our observations, during which the average accretion rate was found to be unusually high. We speculate that the magnetic field of CI Tau is strong enough to sustain most of the time a magnetospheric gap extending to at least 70 per cent of the co-rotation radius, which would explain why the rotation period of CI Tau is as long as 9 d. Our results also imply that the 9 d radial velocity (RV) modulation that CI Tau exhibits is attributable to stellar activity, and thus that the existence of the candidate close-in massive planet CI Tau b to which these RV fluctuations were first attributed needs to be reassessed with new evidence.},

We find that a 6\{M\}\{\{J\}\} planet in a typical disk around a 1\{M\}{$\odot$} star can produce prominent and detectable spiral arms both interior and exterior to its orbit. The inner arms have (1) two well separated arms in roughly m = 2 symmetry, (2) exhibit {$\sim$}10\textdegree -15\textdegree{} pitch angles, (3) {$\sim$}180\textdegree -270\textdegree{} extension in the azimuthal direction, and (4) {$\sim$} 150 \% surface brightness enhancement, all broadly consistent with observed spiral arms in the SAO 206462 and MWC 758 systems. The outer arms cannot explain observations as they are too tightly wound given typical disk scale height. We confirm previous results that the outer density waves excited by a 1\{M\}\{\{J\}\} planet exhibit low contrast in the IR and are practically not detectable. We also find that 3D effects of the waves are important. Compared to isothermal models, density waves in adiabatic disks exhibit weaker contrast in surface density but stronger contrast in scattered light images, due to a more pronounced vertical structure in the former caused by shock heating and maybe hydraulic jump effect. To drive observed pairs of arms with an external companion on a circular orbit, a massive planet, possibly a brown dwarf, is needed at around [r{$\sim$} 0\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 7, \{PA\}{$\sim$} 10\^\textbackslash circ ] (position angle PA from north to east) in SAO 206462 and [r{$\sim$} 0\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 6, \{PA\}{$\sim$} 10\^\textbackslash circ ] in MWC 758.

In particular, a massive disk with q {$\approx$} 0.5 can exhibit grand-design m = 2 spirals. GI-induced arms are in approximate corotation with the local disk, and may therefore trap dust particles by pressure drag. Although GI can produce NIR spiral arms with morphologies, contrasts, and pitch angles similar to those reported in recent observations, it also makes other demands that may or may not be satisfied in any given system. A GI origin requires that the spirals be relatively compact, on scales {$\lessequivlnt$}100 AU; that the disk be massive, q {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.25; and that the accretion rate \textbackslash dot\{\{M\}\textbackslash star \} be high, on the order of 10-6M{$\odot$} yr-1.},

  abstract = {Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI have discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered-light images of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that these arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a quantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet mass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in disks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ({$\delta$}max) as a function of planet mass (\{M\}\{\{p\}\}) and disk aspect ratio (h/r): \{{$\delta$} \}\textbackslash max {$\approx$} \{(\{(\{M\}\{\{p\}\}/\{M\}\{\{J\}\})/(h/r)\}1.38)\}0.22. With current observational capabilities, at a 30 au separation, the minimum planet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr, 1 \{M\}{$\odot$} star at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more massive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore, in observed disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates from a different planet. We also find that only massive perturbers with at least multi-Jupiter masses are capable of driving bright arms with \{{$\delta$} \}\textbackslash max {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkH{$\alpha$} 330, and these arms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find that the morphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely unaffected by a modest level of viscosity with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.01. Finally, the contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO 206462 b at {$\sim$}100 au is about 5\{--\}10 \{M\}\{\{J\}\} in mass.},

They can also lend unique insights into disk masses, which are critical in setting the mass budget for planet formation but are difficult to determine directly. A surprisingly high fraction of disks that have been well studied in scattered light have spiral arms of some kind (8/29), as do a high fraction (6/11) of well-studied Herbig intermediate-mass stars (i.e., Herbig stars {$>$}1.5 M{$\odot$}). Here we explore the origin of spiral arms in Herbig systems by studying their occurrence rates, disk properties, and stellar accretion rates. We find that two-arm spirals are more common in disks surrounding Herbig intermediate-mass stars than are directly imaged giant planet companions to mature A and B stars. If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets, this discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by hot-start models. In addition, the high stellar accretion rates of Herbig stars, if sustained over a reasonable fraction of their lifetimes, suggest that disk masses are much larger than inferred from their submillimeter continuum emission. As a result, gravitational instability is a possible explanation for multiarm spirals. Future observations can lend insights into the issues raised here.},

Moreover, in the low-viscosity limit, we find no minimum mass necessary to open a gap for a planet held on a fixed orbit. In particular, a Neptune-mass planet will open a gap in a minimum mass solar nebula with suitably low viscosity ({$\alpha$} {$<\sptilde$} 10-4). We find that the mass threshold scales as the square root of viscosity in the low mass regime. This is because the gap width for critical planet masses in this regime is a fixed multiple of the scale height, not of the Hill radius of the planet.},

  abstract = {Most standard descriptions of Type II migration state that massive, gap-opening planets must migrate at the viscous drift rate. This is based on the idea that the disk is separated into an inner and outer region and gas is considered unable to cross the gap. In fact, gas easily crosses the gap on horseshoe orbits, nullifying this necessary premise which would set the migration rate. In this work, it is demonstrated using highly accurate numerical calculations that the actual migration rate is dependent on disk and planet parameters, and can be significantly larger or smaller than the viscous drift rate. In the limiting case of a disk much more massive than the secondary, the migration rate saturates to a constant that is sensitive to disk parameters and is not necessarily of the order of the viscous rate. In the opposite limit of a low-mass disk, the migration rate decreases linearly with disk mass. Steady-state solutions in the low disk mass limit show no pile-up outside the secondary's orbit, and no corresponding drainage of the inner disk.},

Formulas for gap depth and width are determined, which are combined to form a complete formula for surface density as a function of radius in the disk. This new analytical formula is compared with numerically derived gaps opened by planets ranging from very low masses up to a few times Jupiter's mass, and excellent agreement is found over a wide range of parameter space relevant to planet-disk interactions.

The DSHARP campaign shows that several of these rings are very narrow in radial extent. In this Letter we test the hypothesis that these dust rings are caused by dust trapping in radial pressure bumps, and if confirmed, put constraints on the physics of the dust trapping mechanism. We model this process analytically in 1D, assuming axisymmetry. By comparing this model to the data, we find that all rings are consistent with dust trapping. Based on a plausible model of the dust temperature we find that several rings are narrower than the pressure scale height, providing strong evidence for dust trapping. The rings have peak absorption optical depth in the range between 0.2 and 0.5. The dust masses stored in each of these rings is of the order of tens of Earth masses, though much ambiguity remains due to the uncertainty of the dust opacities. The dust rings are dense enough to potentially trigger the streaming instability, but our analysis cannot give proof of this mechanism actually operating.

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks composed of dust and gas are ubiquitous around young stars and are commonly recognized as nurseries of planetary systems. Their lifetime, appearance, and structure are determined by an interplay between stellar radiation, gravity, thermal pressure, magnetic field, gas viscosity, turbulence, and rotation. Molecules and dust serve as major heating and cooling agents in disks. Dust grains dominate the disk opacities, reprocess most of the stellar radiation, and shield molecules from ionizing ultraviolet (UV)/X-ray photons. Disks also dynamically evolve by building up planetary systems, which drastically change their gas and dust density structures. Over the past decade, significant progress has been achieved in our understanding of disk chemical composition thanks to the upgrade or advent of new millimeter/infrared (IR) facilities [Submillimeter Array (SMA), Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), Herschel, Expanded Very Large Array (e-VLA), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)]. Some major breakthroughs in our comprehension of the disk physics and chemistry have been done since Protostars and Planets V (Reipurth et al., 2007). This review will present and discuss the impact of such improvements on our understanding of the disk physical structure and chemical composition.},

With a beam size of 80 mas \texttimes{} 30 mas at a position angle of 2\textdegree, the high angular resolution observations resolved the disk in the east-west direction (along the plane of the disk) in both continuum and the line emission for the first time. With spatially resolved images of the maser emission, we are able to produce and analyze rotation curves for the H30{$\alpha$} transition with greater precision than before.

This inference relies both on simulations as well as the linear theory of planet-disc interaction developed for planets on circular orbits to predict the morphology of the density wake. In this work, we develop and implement a linear framework for calculating the structure of the density wave in a gaseous disc driven by an eccentric planet. Our approach takes into account both the essential azimuthal and temporal periodicities of the problem, allowing us to treat any periodic perturbing potential (i.e. not only that of an eccentric planet). We test our framework by calculating the morphology of the density waves excited by an eccentric, low-mass planet embedded in a globally isothermal disc and compare our results to the recent direct numerical simulations (and heuristic wavelet analysis) of the same problem by Zhu and Zhang. We find excellent agreement with the numerical simulations, capturing all the complex eccentric features including spiral bifurcations, wave crossings, and planet-wave detachments, with improved accuracy and detail compared with the wavelet method. This illustrates the power of our linear framework in reproducing the morphology of complicated time-dependent density wakes, presenting it as a valuable tool for future studies of eccentric planet-disc interactions.},

Our goal is twofold: to determine the spatial distribution of dust depending on grain size and planet mass, and therefore to provide a framework for interpretation of coming observations and future studies of planetesimal growth. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Methods: We numerically model the evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk using a two-fluid (gas + dust) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, which is non-self-gravitating and locally isothermal. The code follows the three dimensional distribution of dust in a protoplanetary disk as it interacts with the gas via aerodynamic drag. In this work, we present the evolution of a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) disk comprising 1\% dust by mass in the presence of an embedded planet. We run a series of simulations which vary the grain size and planetary mass to see how they affect the resulting disk structure. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Results: We find that gap formation is much more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gaseous disk and that a system with a given stellar, disk and planetary mass will have a completely different appearance depending on the grain size. For low mass planets in our MMSN disk, a gap can open in the dust disk while not in the gas disk. We also note that dust accumulates at the external edge of the planetary gap and speculate that the presence of a planet in the disk may enhance the formation of a second planet by facilitating the growth of planetesimals in this high density region.},

While sub-micron- and micron-sized dust grains are generally well mixed with the gas phase in protoplanetary disks, larger grains will be partially decoupled and as a consequence have a different distribution from that of the gas. This has ramifications for predictions of the observability of protoplanetary disks, for which gas-only studies will provide an inaccurate picture. Specifically, criteria for gap opening in the presence of a planet have generally been studied for the gas phase, whereas the situation can be quite different in the dust layer once grains reach mm sizes, which is what will be observed by ALMA. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to investigate the formation and structure of a planetary gap in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk with an embedded planet. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We perform 3D, gas+dust SPH simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a planet on a fixed circular orbit at 40 AU to study the evolution of both the gas and dust distributions and densities in the disk. We run a series of simulations in which the planet mass and the dust grain size varies. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We show that the gap in the dust layer is more striking than in the gas phase and that it is deeper and wider for more massive planets as well as for larger grains. For a massive enough planet, we note that cm-sized grains remain inside the gap in corotation and that their population in the outer disk shows an asymmetric structure, a signature of disk-planet interactions even for a circular planetary orbit, which should be observable with ALMA.},

Using two and three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to perform a systematic parameter survey, we confirm the existence of multiple spiral arms in disks with a single planet, and discover a scaling relation between the azimuthal separation of the primary and secondary arm, \{{$\varphi$} \}\{\{sep\}\}, and the planet-to-star mass ratio q: \{{$\varphi$} \}\{\{sep\}\}=102\^\textbackslash circ \{(q/0.001)\}0.2 for companions between Neptune mass and 16 Jupiter masses around a 1 solar mass star, and \{{$\varphi$} \}\{\{sep\}\}=180\^\textbackslash circ for brown dwarf mass companions. This relation is independent of the disk's temperature, and can be used to infer a planet's mass to within an accuracy of about 30\% given only the morphology of a face-on disk. Combining hydrodynamics and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we verify that our numerical measurements of \{{$\varphi$} \}\{\{sep\}\} are accurate representations of what would be measured in near-infrared scattered light images, such as those expected to be taken by Gemini/GPI, Very Large Telescope/SPHERE, or Subaru/SCExAO in the future. Finally, we are able to infer, using our scaling relation, that the planet responsible for the spiral structure in SAO 206462 has a mass of about 6 Jupiter masses.},

The growth from grains to pebbles and from planetesimals to planets is now fairly well understood. The intermediate stage has however been found to be hindered by the radial-drift and fragmentation barriers. We identify a powerful mechanism in which dust overcomes both barriers. Its key ingredients are (I) backreaction from the dust on to the gas, (II) grain growth and fragmentation and (III) large-scale gradients. The pile-up of growing and fragmenting grains modifies the gas structure on large scales and triggers the formation of pressure maxima, in which particles are trapped. We show that these self-induced dust traps are robust: they develop for a wide range of disc structures, fragmentation thresholds and initial dust-to-gas ratios. They are favoured locations for pebbles to grow into planetesimals, thus opening new paths towards the formation of planets.},

We use this as input to an approximate but quantitative nonlinear theory based on Burger's equation for the subsequent propagation and shock. Shock damping is indeed local, but weakly so. If all metals in a minimum-mass solar nebula are invested in planets of a few Earth masses each, dimensionless viscosities ({$\alpha$}) of the order of -4 dex to -3 dex result. We compare this with observational constraints. Such small planets would have escaped detection in radial velocity surveys and could be ubiquitous. If so, then the similarity of the observed lifetime of T Tauri disks to the theoretical timescale for assembling a rocky planet may be fate rather than coincidence.},

However, a clear detection of still-forming planets embedded within gas-rich disks is still rare. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: HD 169142 is a very young Herbig Ae-Be star surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at least three rings. While claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously, follow-up studies remain inconclusive. The complex structure of this disk is not yet well understood. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We used the high contrast imager SPHERE at ESO Very large Telescope to obtain a sequence of high-resolution, high-contrast images of the immediate surroundings of this star over about three years in the wavelength range 0.95-2.25 {$\mu$}m. This enables a photometric and astrometric analysis of the structures in the disk. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: While we were unable to definitively confirm the previous claims of a massive sub-stellar object at 0.1-0.15 arcsec from the star, we found both spirals and blobs within the disk. The spiral pattern may be explained as due to the presence of a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary arm excited by a planet of a few Jupiter masses lying along the primary arm, likely in the cavities between the rings. The blobs orbit the star consistently with Keplerian motion, allowing a dynamical determination of the mass of the star. While most of these blobs are located within the rings, we found that one of them lies in the cavity between the rings, along the primary arm of the spiral design. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: This blob might be due to a planet that might also be responsible for the spiral pattern observed within the rings and for the cavity between the two rings. The planet itself is not detected at short wavelengths, where we only see a dust cloud illuminated by stellar light, but the planetary photosphere might be responsible for the emission observed in the K1 and K2 bands. The mass ofthis putative planet may be constrained using photometric and dynamical arguments. While uncertainties are large, the mass should be between 1 and 4 Jupiter masses.

  abstract = {It has recently been noted that many discs around T Tauri stars appear to comprise only a few Jupiter masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of discs within six local star formation regions, we confirm this result, and find that only a few per cent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency of observed exoplanets is greater than this, there is a `missing-mass' problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust flux to disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but trends in multiplanet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical models suggest that the gas accretion time-scale is too short for migration to sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to millimetre dust flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the protostellar stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exoplanets. Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the objects have potentially unstable discs of {$>\sptilde$}30 per cent of the stellar mass. However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 au by instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results presented suggest that the canonically `protoplanetary' discs of Class II T Tauri stars have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to planetary cores) must already have occurred.},

  abstract = {A key process in planet formation is the exchange of angular momentum between a growing planet and the protoplanetary disc, which makes the planet migrate through the disc. Several works show that in general low-mass and intermediate-mass planets migrate towards the central star, unless corotation torques become dominant. Recently, a new kind of torque, called the thermal torque, was proposed as a new source that can generate outward migration of low-mass planets. While the Lindblad and corotation torques depend mostly on the properties of the protoplanetary disc and on the planet mass, the thermal torque depends also on the luminosity of the planet, arising mainly from the accretion of solids. Thus, the accretion of solids plays an important role not only in the formation of the planet but also in its migration process. In a previous work, we evaluated the thermal torque effects on planetary growth and migration mainly in the planetesimal accretion paradigm. In this new work, we study the role of the thermal torque within the pebble accretion paradigm. Computations are carried out consistently in the framework of a global model of planet formation that includes disc evolution, dust growth and evolution, and pebble formation. We also incorporate updated prescriptions of the thermal torque derived from high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Our simulations show that the thermal torque generates extended regions of outward migration in low-viscosity discs. This has a significant impact in the formation of the planets.},

The temperature of the mm-emitting dust is constrained in a few systems. Unambiguous evidence for large grains is obtained by resolving out disks with very low values of the dust emissivity index {$\beta$}. In most disks that are sufficiently resolved at two different wavelengths, we find a radial dependence of {$\beta$}, which appears to increase from low values (as low as 0) at the center to about 1.7-2 at the disk edge. The same behavior could apply to all studied disks. It introduces further ambiguities in interpreting the brightness profile, because the regions with apparent {$\beta$} {$\approx$} 0 can also be interpreted as being optically thick when their brightness temperature is high enough. Despite the added uncertainty on the dust absorption coefficient, the characteristic size of the disk appears to increase with a higher estimated star age. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: These results provide the first direct evidence of the radial dependence of the grain size in proto-planetary disks.

AS 209 hosts one of the most unusual disks from the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project sample, the first high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array survey of disks, as nearly all of the emission can be explained with concentric Gaussian rings. In particular, the dust emission consists of a series of narrow and closely spaced rings in the inner {$\sim$}60 au, two well-separated bright rings in the outer disk, centered at 74 and 120 au, and at least two fainter emission features at 90 and 130 au. We model the visibilities with a parametric representation of the radial surface brightness profile, consisting of a central core and seven concentric Gaussian rings. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of low-viscosity disks show that super-Earth planets can produce the multiple gaps seen in AS 209 millimeter continuum emission. The 12CO line emission is centrally peaked and extends out to {$\sim$}300 au, much farther than the millimeter dust emission. We find axisymmetric, localized deficits of CO emission around four distinct radii, near 45, 75, 120, and 210 au. The outermost gap is located well beyond the edge of the millimeter dust emission, and therefore cannot be due to dust opacity and must be caused by a genuine CO surface density reduction, due either to chemical effects or depletion of the overall gas content.},

We present high-angular-resolution (10-50 au) observations of C2H, HCN, and H2CO lines in five protoplanetary disks from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program. We derive column density and excitation temperature profiles for HCN and C2H, and find that the HCN emission arises in a temperate (20-30 K) layer in the disk, while C2H is present in relatively warmer (20-60 K) layers. In the case of HD 163296, we find a decrease in column density for HCN and C2H inside one of the dust gaps near \textasciitilde 83 au, where a planet has been proposed to be located. We derive H2CO column density profiles assuming temperatures between 20 and 50 K, and find slightly higher column densities in the colder disks around T Tauri stars than around Herbig Ae stars. The H2CO column densities rise near the location of the CO snowline and/or millimeter dust edge, suggesting an efficient release of H2CO ices in the outer disk. Finally, we find that the inner 50 au of these disks are rich in organic species, with abundances relative to water that are similar to cometary values. Comets could therefore deliver water and key organics to future planets in these disks, similar to what might have happened here on Earth.

Disks with sufficiently high masses can excite gravitational instability and drive spiral arms that are detectable with ALMA. Although spirals have been detected in ALMA observations of the dust, their association with gravitational instability, and high disk masses, is far from clear. Here we report a prediction for kinematic evidence of gravitational instability. Using hydrodynamics simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations, we show that a disk undergoing such instability has clear kinematic signatures in molecular line observations across the entire disk azimuth and radius, which are independent of viewing angle. If these signatures are detected, it will provide the clearest evidence for the occurrence of gravitational instability in planet-forming disks, and provide a crucial way to measure disk masses.},

Linear theory has shown that this heating torque gives rise to a migration term linear in the body's mass that can oppose or even reverse that arising from the sum of gravitational Lindblad and co-orbital torques. We use high-resolution local three-dimensional shearing sheet simulations of a zero-mass test particle in an unstratified disk to assess the accuracy and domain of applicability of the linear theory. We find agreement between analytic and simulation results to better than 10\% in the low-luminosity, low thermal conductivity regime but measure deviations in both the nonlinear (high-luminosity) and high thermal conductivity regimes. In the nonlinear regime, linear theory overpredicts the acceleration due to the heating torque, potentially due to the neglect of nonlinear terms in the heat flux. In the high thermal conductivity regime, linear theory underpredicts the acceleration, which scales with a power-law index of -1 rather than -3/2, although here both nonlinear and computational constraints play a role. We discuss the impact of the heating torque for the evolution of low-mass planets in protoplanetary disks and massive stars or accreting compact objects embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. For the latter case, we show that the thermal torque is likely to be the dominant physical effect at disk radii where the optical depth drops below \$\textbackslash tau \textbackslash lesssim 0.07\{\textbackslash alpha \}\^\{-3/2\}\textbackslash epsilon c/\{v\}\_\{K\}\$ .},

The median accretion rate for T Tauri stars of age \textasciitilde 1 Myr is \textasciitilde 10-8 M{$\odot$} yr-1 the intrinsic scatter at a given age may be as large as 1 order of magnitude. There is a clear decline of mass accretion rates \.M with increasing age t among T Tauri stars. Representing this decline as \.M\textasciitilde t-{$\eta$}, we estimate 1.5 {$<\sptilde$} {$\eta$} {$<\sptilde$} 2.8; the large uncertainty is due to the wide range of accretion rates at a given age, the limited age range of the sample, and errors in estimating stellar ages and accretion luminosities. Adopting values of {$\eta$} near the low end of this range, which are more likely given probable errors and the neglect of birthline age corrections, masses accreted during the T Tauri phase are roughly consistent with disk masses estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission. Similarity solutions for evolving, expanding disks are used to investigate observational constraints on disk properties employing a minimum of parameters. For an assumed power-law form of the disk viscosity with radius {$\nu$} \textasciitilde{} R{$\gamma$}, {$\eta$} {$>\sptilde$} 1.5 corresponds to {$\gamma$} {$>\sptilde$} 1. The limit {$\gamma$} \textasciitilde{} 1 corresponds to a roughly constant ``{$\alpha$}'' in the Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) viscosity parameterization; using current observed disk sizes, we estimate {$\alpha$} \textasciitilde{} 10-2 (on scales \textasciitilde 10-100 AU). Much of the observed variation in mass accretion rates can be accounted for by varying initial disk masses between 0.01 and 0.2 M{$\odot$}, but this result may be strongly affected by the presence of binary companion stars. These results emphasize the need for older samples of stars for studying disk evolution.},

  abstract = {First, distributions of surface densities of dust materials and gases in a preplanetary solar nebula, which give a good fit to the distribution of the planetary mass, are presented and the over-all structure of this nebula, which is in thermal and gravitational equilibrium, is studied. Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected. Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.},

  abstract = {We study and elucidate the mechanism of spiral density wave excitation in a differentially rotating flow with turbulence which could result from the magneto-rotational instability. We formulate a set of wave equations with sources that are only non-zero in the presence of turbulent fluctuations. We solve these in a shearing box domain, subject to the boundary conditions of periodicity in shearing coordinates, using a WKBJ method. It is found that, for a particular azimuthal wavelength, the wave excitation occurs through a sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in shearing discs with turbulence. Trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating in opposite directions are produced, both of which produce an outward angular momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters and azimuthal wavelength. By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically, we justify the WKBJ approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In order to quantify the wave excitation completely, the important wave source terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak non-linearity, these can be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime. Under the additional assumption that the source has a flat power spectrum at long azimuthal wavelengths, the optimal azimuthal wavelength produced is found to be determined solely by the WKBJ response and is estimated to be 2{$\pi$}H, with H being the nominal disc scaleheight. In a following paper by Heinemann \& Papaloizou, we perform direct three-dimensional simulations and compare results manifesting the wave excitation process and its source with the assumptions made and the theory developed here in detail, finding excellent agreement.},

In agreement with previous studies, we find that dust disk sizes and millimeter luminosities are correlated, but show for the first time that the relationship is not universal between regions. We find that disks in the 2-3 Myr old Cha I are not smaller than disks in other regions of similar age, and confirm the Barenfeld et al. finding that the 5-10 Myr USco disks are smaller than disks belonging to younger regions. Finally, we find that the outer edge of the solar system, as defined by the Kuiper Belt, is consistent with a population of dust disk sizes which have not experienced significant truncation.},

  abstract = {The picture of the magnetic field of the Galaxy discussed in earlier papers is unsatisfactory in that it does not provide for an oufflow of gas from the galactic nucleus. The observed lack of any inward flow of gas suggests that the interstellar medium must constantly gain angular momentum. But unless the galactic halo holds the main reservoir of gas and angular momentum, it is difficult to see how this can be the case. It is now suggested that, instead of the spiral arm field being primary and the halo field secondary, as it was in our earlier work, the situation may be reversed. In a model in which lines of force of the halo cross the interarm regions of the galactic plane, it is possible for the whole interstellar medium to gain angular momentum at a comparatively rapid rate. The windings of the spiral arms then move outwards, thereby preventing the arms from becoming more tightly wound with time. when the field intensity in the halo is 3 x gauss, the windings move out to the periphery of the Galaxy in a time scale of order S X 108 years. The structure of the spiral arm field, according to this new picture, is briefly discussed. It seems that a helical structure is to be preferred to the usual cylindrical model. A well-known difficulty concerning the direction of the local spiral arm is then overcome.},

All three disks feature m = 2 spiral patterns in conjunction with annular substructures. Gas kinematics established by 12CO J = 2-1 observations indicate that the continuum spiral arms are trailing. The arm-interarm intensity contrasts are modest, typically less than 3. The Elias 27 spiral pattern extends throughout much of the disk, and the arms intersect the gap at R {$\sim$} 69 au. The spiral pattern in the IM Lup disk is particularly complex\textemdash it extends about halfway radially through the disk, exhibiting pitch angle variations with radius and interarm features that may be part of ring substructures or spiral arm branches. Spiral arms also extend most of the way through the WaOph 6 disk, but the source overall is much more compact than the other two disks. We discuss possible origins for the spiral structures, including gravitational instability and density waves induced by a stellar or planetary companion. Unlike the millimeter continuum counterparts of many of the disks with spiral arms detected in scattered light, these three sources do not feature high-contrast crescent-like asymmetries or large (R {$>$} 20 au) emission cavities. This difference may point to multiple spiral formation mechanisms operating in disks.},

  abstract = {Several nearby protoplanetary disks have been observed to display large-scale crescents in the (sub)millimeter dust continuum emission. One interpretation is that these structures correspond to anticyclonic vortices generated by the Rossby wave instability within the gaseous disk. Such vortices have local gas overdensities and are expected to concentrate dust particles with a Stokes number around unity. This process might catalyze the formation of planetesimals. Whereas recent observations showed that dust crescents are indeed regions where millimeter-size particles have abnormally high concentration relative to the gas and smaller grains, no observations have yet shown that the gas within the crescent region counterrotates with respect to the protoplanetary disk. Here we investigate the detectability of anticyclonic features through measurement of the line-of-sight component of the gas velocity obtained with ALMA. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations and 3D radiative transfer calculations of a protoplanetary disk characterized by a vortex created by the tidal interaction with a massive planet. As a case study, the disk parameters are chosen to mimic the IRS 48 system, which has the most prominent crescent observed to date. We generate synthetic ALMA observations of both the dust continuum and 12CO emission around the frequency of 345 GHz. We find that the anticyclonic features of the vortex are weak but can be detected if both the source and the observational setup are properly chosen. We provide a recipe for maximizing the probability of detecting such vortex features and present an analysis procedure to infer their kinematic properties.},

We present a systematic analysis of annular substructures in the 18 single-disk systems targeted in this survey. No dominant architecture emerges from this sample; instead, remarkably diverse morphologies are observed. Annular substructures can occur at virtually any radius where millimeter continuum emission is detected and range in widths from a few astronomical units to tens of astronomical units. Intensity ratios between gaps and adjacent rings range from near-unity to just a few percent. In a minority of cases, annular substructures coexist with other types of substructures, including spiral arms (3/18) and crescent-like azimuthal asymmetries (2/18). No clear trend is observed between the positions of the substructures and stellar host properties. In particular, the absence of an obvious association with stellar host luminosity (and hence the disk thermal structure) suggests that substructures do not occur preferentially near major molecular snowlines. Annular substructures like those observed in DSHARP have long been hypothesized to be due to planet-disk interactions. A few disks exhibit characteristics particularly suggestive of this scenario, including substructures in possible mean-motion resonance and ``double gap'' features reminiscent of hydrodynamical simulations of multiple gaps opened by a planet in a low-viscosity disk.},

The dust continuum shows at least three rings atop faint, extended emission. Unresolved emission is detected at the center of the disk cavity at both wavelengths, likely due to a combination of dust and free-free emission. Compared to the 1.1 mm image, the 2.1 mm image shows a more pronounced "shoulder" near R {$\sim$} 40 au, highlighting the utility of longer-wavelength observations for characterizing disk substructures. The spectral index {$\alpha$} features strong radial variations, with minima near the emission peaks and maxima near the gaps. While low spectral indices have often been ascribed to grain growth and dust trapping, the optical depth of GM Aur's inner two emission rings renders their dust properties ambiguous. The gaps and outer disk (R {$>$} 100 au) are optically thin at both wavelengths. Meanwhile, the HCO+ emission indicates that the gas cavity is more compact than the dust cavity traced by the millimeter continuum, similar to other disks traditionally classified as "transitional."},

  abstract = {The concentric gaps and rings commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in millimeter continuum emission have lent the impression that planet formation generally proceeds within orderly, isolated systems. While deep observations of spatially resolved molecular emission have been comparatively limited, they are increasingly suggesting that some disks interact with their surroundings while planet formation is underway. We present an analysis of complex features identified around GM Aur in 12CO J = 2 - 1 images at a spatial resolution of \textasciitilde 40 au. In addition to a Keplerian disk extending to a radius of \textasciitilde 550 au, the CO emission traces flocculent spiral arms out to radii of \textasciitilde 1200 au, a tail extending \textasciitilde 1800 au southwest of GM Aur, and diffuse structures extending from the north side of the disk up to radii of \textasciitilde 1900 au. The diffuse structures coincide with a "dust ribbon" previously identified in scattered light. The large-scale asymmetric gas features present a striking contrast with the mostly axisymmetric, multi-ringed millimeter continuum tracing the pebble disk. We hypothesize that GM Aur's complex gas structures result from late infall of remnant envelope or cloud material onto the disk. The morphological similarities to the SU Aur and AB Aur systems, which are also located in the L1517 cloud, provide additional support to a scenario in which interactions with the environment are playing a role in regulating the distribution and transport of material in all three of these Class II disk systems.

  abstract = {The precursors to larger, biologically relevant molecules are detected throughout interstellar space, but determining the presence and properties of these molecules during planet formation requires observations of protoplanetary disks at high angular resolution and sensitivity. Here, we present 0"3 observations of HC3N, CH3CN, and c-C3H2 in five protoplanetary disks observed as part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program. We robustly detect all molecules in four of the disks (GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480) with tentative detections of c-C3H2 and CH3CN in IM Lup. We observe a range of morphologies-central peaks, single or double rings-with no clear correlation in morphology between molecule or disk. Emission is generally compact and on scales comparable with the millimeter dust continuum. We perform both disk-integrated and radially resolved rotational diagram analysis to derive column densities and rotational temperatures. The latter reveals 5-10 times more column density in the inner 50-100 au of the disks when compared with the disk-integrated analysis. We demonstrate that CH3CN originates from lower relative heights in the disks when compared with HC3N, in some cases directly tracing the disk midplane. Finally, we find good agreement between the ratio of small to large nitriles in the outer disks and comets. Our results indicate that the protoplanetary disks studied here are host to significant reservoirs of large organic molecules, and that this planet- and comet-building material can be chemically similar to that in our own solar system.

The image of the disk recorded in the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals three dark concentric rings that indicate the presence of dust depleted gaps at about 60, 100, and 160 A.U. from the central star. The maps of the 12CO, 13CO, and C 18O J =2 -1 emission do not show such structures but reveal a change in the slope of the radial intensity profile across the positions of the dark rings in the continuum image. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for the disk emission, we find that the density of CO molecules is reduced inside the middle and outer dust gaps. However, in the inner ring there is no evidence of CO depletion. From the measurements of the dust and gas densities, we deduce that the gas-to-dust ratio varies across the disk and, in particular, it increases by at least a factor 5 within the inner dust gap compared to adjacent regions of the disk. The depletion of both dust and gas suggests that the middle and outer rings could be due to the gravitational torque exerted by two Saturn-mass planets orbiting at 100 and 160 A.U. from the star. On the other hand, the inner dust gap could result from dust accumulation at the edge of a magnetorotational instability dead zone, or from dust opacity variations at the edge of the CO frost line. Observations of the dust emission at higher angular resolution and of molecules that probe dense gas are required to establish more precisely the origins of the dark rings observed in the HD 163296 disk.},

In this Letter, we present and discuss observations of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk that imaged the 1.25 mm dust continuum and 12CO J = 2-1 rotational line emission at a spatial resolution of 4 and 10 au, respectively. The continuum observations resolve and allow us to characterize the previously discovered dust rings at radii of 68 and 100. They also reveal new small-scale structures, such as a dark gap at 10 au, a bright ring at 15 au, a dust crescent at a radius of 55 au, and several fainter azimuthal asymmetries. The observations of the CO and dust emission provide information about the vertical structure of the disk and allow us to directly constrain the dust extinction optical depth at the dust rings. Furthermore, the observed asymmetries in the dust continuum emission corroborate the hypothesis that the complex structure of the HD 163296 disk is the result of the gravitational interaction with yet-unseen planets.},

  abstract = {Context. The study of disc kinematics has recently opened up as a promising method to detect unseen planets. However, a systematic, statistically meaningful analysis of such an approach remains missing in the field. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: The aim of this work is to devise an automated, statistically robust technique to identify and quantify kinematical perturbations induced by the presence of planets in a gas disc, and to accurately infer the location of the planets. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We produced hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disc interactions with different planet masses, namely 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 M\textsubscript{Jup}, at a radius of R\textsubscript{p} = 100 au in the disc, and performed radiative transfer calculations of CO to simulate observables for a disc inclination of - 45\textdegree, and for 13 planet azimuths. We then fitted the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel emission using the DISCMINER package. Lastly, we compared the synthetic cubes with the best-fit model to: extract deviations from Keplerian rotation; and quantify both large-scale and localised intensity, line width, and velocity fluctuations triggered by the embedded planets and provide strong constraints on their location in the disc. We assess the statistical significance of the detections using the peak and variance of the planet-driven velocity fluctuations. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Our findings suggest that a careful inspection of line intensity profiles to analyse gas kinematics in discs is a robust method to reveal embedded, otherwise unseen planets, as well as the location of gas gaps. We claim that a simultaneous study of line-of-sight velocities and intensities is crucial to understanding the origin of the observed velocity perturbations. In particular, the combined contribution of the upper and lower emitting surfaces of the disc plays a central role in setting the observed gas velocities. This joint effect is especially prominent and hard to predict at the location of a gap or cavity, which can lead to artificial deviations from Keplerian rotation depending on how the disc velocities are retrieved. Furthermore, regardless of their origin, gas gaps alone are capable of producing kink-like features on intensity channel maps, which are often attributed to the presence of planets. Our technique, based on line centroid differences, takes all this into account to capture only the strongest, localised, planet-driven perturbations. It does not get confused by axisymmetric velocity perturbations that may result from non-planetary mechanisms. The method can detect all three simulated planets, at all azimuths, with an average accuracy of {$\pm$}3\textdegree{} in azimuth and {$\pm$}8 au in radius. As expected, velocity fluctuations driven by planets increase in magnitude as a function of the planet mass. Furthermore, owing to disc structure and line-of-sight projection effects, planets at azimuths close to {$\pm$}45\textdegree{} yield the highest velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases, 0\textdegree{} and {$\pm$}90\textdegree, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities typically range within 40-70, 70-170, and 130-450 m s\textsuperscript{-1} for 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 M\textsubscript{Jup} planets, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the variance of peak velocities is boosted near planets because of organised gas motions prompted by the localised gravitational well of planets. We propose an approach that exploits this velocity coherence to provide, for the first time, statistically significant detections of localised planet-driven perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.},

  abstract = {We report the robust detection of coherent, localized deviations from Keplerian rotation possibly associated with the presence of two giant planets embedded in the disk around HD 163296. The analysis is performed using the DISCMINER channel map modeling framework on 12CO J = 2-1 DSHARP data. Not only orbital radius but also azimuth of the planets are retrieved by our technique. One of the candidate planets, detected at R = 94 {$\pm$} 6 au, {$\phi$} = 50\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 3\textdegree{} (P94), is near the center of one of the gaps in dust continuum emission and is consistent with a planet mass of 1 M Jup. The other planet, located at R = 261 {$\pm$} 4 au, {$\phi$} = 57\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 1\textdegree{} (P261), is in the region where a velocity kink was previously observed in 12CO channel maps. Also, we provide a simultaneous description of the height and temperature of the upper and lower emitting surfaces of the disk and propose the line width as a solid observable to track gas substructure. Using azimuthally averaged line width profiles, we detect gas gaps at R = 38, 88, and 136 au, closely matching the location of their dust and kinematical counterparts. Furthermore, we observe strong azimuthal asymmetries in line widths around the gas gap at R = 88 au, possibly linked to turbulent motions driven by the P94 planet. Our results confirm that the DISCMINER is capable of finding localized, otherwise unseen velocity perturbations thanks to its robust statistical framework, but also that it is well suited for studies of the gas properties and vertical structure of protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {The {$\sim$}2 Myr old classical T Tauri star CI Tau shows periodic variability in its radial velocity (RV) variations measured at infrared (IR) and optical wavelengths. We find that these observations are consistent with a massive planet in a {$\sim$}9 day period orbit. These results are based on 71 IR RV measurements of this system obtained over five years, and on 26 optical RV measurements obtained over nine years. CI Tau was also observed photometrically in the optical on 34 nights over {$\sim$}one month in 2012. The optical RV data alone are inadequate to identify an orbital period, likely the result of star spot and activity-induced noise for this relatively small data set. The infrared RV measurements reveal significant periodicity at {$\sim$}9 days. In addition, the full set of optical and IR RV measurements taken together phase coherently and with equal amplitudes to the {$\sim$}9 day period. Periodic RV signals can in principle be produced by cool spots, hotspots, and reflection of the stellar spectrum off the inner disk, in addition to resulting from a planetary companion. We have considered each of these and find the planet hypothesis most consistent with the data. The RV amplitude yields an M\textbackslash sin I of {$\sim$}8.1 M Jup; in conjunction with a 1.3 mm continuum emission measurement of the circumstellar disk inclination from the literature, we find a planet mass of {$\sim$}11.3 M Jup, assuming alignment of the planetary orbit with the disk.

However, most previous studies have been limited to cases where the magnetic field and the rotation axis of the cloud are aligned. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We study the transport of angular momentum, and its effects on disk formation, for non-aligned initial configurations and a range of magnetic intensities. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We perform three-dimensional, adaptive mesh, numerical simulations of magnetically supercritical collapsing dense cores using the magneto-hydrodynamic code Ramses. We compute the contributions of all the relevant processes transporting angular momentum, in both the envelope and the region of the disk. We clearly define centrifugally supported disks and thoroughly study their properties. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: At variance with earlier analyses, we show that the transport of angular momentum acts less efficiently in collapsing cores with non-aligned rotation and magnetic field. Analytically, this result can be understood by taking into account the bending of field lines occurring during the gravitational collapse. For the transport of angular momentum, we conclude that magnetic braking in the mean direction of the magnetic field tends to dominate over both the gravitational and outflow transport of angular momentum. We find that massive disks, containing at least 10\% of the initial core mass, can form during the earliest stages of star formation even for mass-to-flux ratios as small as three to five times the critical value. At higher field intensities, the early formation of massive disks is prevented. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Given the ubiquity of Class I disks, and because the early formation of massive disks can take place at moderate magnetic intensities, we speculate that for stronger fields, disks will form later, when most of the envelope will have been accreted. In addition, we speculate that some observed early massive disks may actually be outflow cavities, mistaken for disks by projection effects.},

We report the detection of a point-like source candidate at 1"1 (174.9 au) for RU Lup and at 0"42 (55 au) for Elias 24. In the case of RU Lup, the proper motion of the candidate is consistent with a stationary background contaminant, based on the astrometry derived from our observations and available archival data. For Elias 24 the point-like source candidate is located in one of the disk gaps at 55 au. Assuming that it is a planetary companion, our analysis suggests a mass ranging from 0.5MJ up to 5MJ, depending on the presence of a circumplanetary disk and its contribution to the luminosity of the system. However, no clear confirmation is obtained at this stage, and follow-up observations are mandatory to verify that the proposed source is physical, comoving with the stellar host, and associated with a young massive planet sculpting the gap observed at 55 au. For all the remaining systems, the lack of detections suggests the presence of planetary companions with masses lower than 5MJ, based on our derived mass detection limits. This is consistent with predictions of both hydrodynamical simulations and kinematical signatures on the disk and allows us to set upper limits on the presence of massive planets in these young disks.},

While one of the most compelling explanations is that they are driven by planetary or stellar companions, in all but one cases such companions have not yet been detected and there is even ambiguity on whether the planet should be located inside or outside the spirals. Here, we use 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the morphology of spiral density waves launched by embedded planets taking into account the vertical temperature gradient, a natural consequence of stellar irradiation. Our simulations show that the pitch angle of the spirals in thermally stratified discs is the lowest in the disc mid-plane and increases towards the disc surface. We combine the hydrodynamic simulations with 3D radiative transfer calculations to predict that the pitch angle of planetary spirals observed in the near-infrared is higher than in the submillimetre. We also find that in both cases the spirals converge towards the planet. This provides a new powerful observational method to determine if the perturbing planet is inside or outside the spirals, as well as map the thermal stratification of the disc.},

These models incorporate a spatially constant epicyclic frequency, unperturbed surface density, Schwarzschild velocity distribution, and rate of rectilinear shear; motions perpendicular to their planes are not considered here. A small-perturbation analysis of the collision-free Boltzmann equation for these models shows that their infinitesimal, "non-axisymmetric" initial disturbances eventually must all phase-damp away. However, even when their remaining "axisymmetric" instabilities have been avoided by a sufficient velocity dispersion, these shearing star disk models remain responsive in a remarkably spiral4ike and vigorous manner to such perturbing gravity forces as might in reality arise from discrete, orbiting aggregates of interstellar material. It must be cautioned, though, that these results strictly apply only to the comparatively "local" models discussed herein and not necessarily to complete star disks.},

  abstract = {A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk forms a gap. An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass Mp, disk aspect ratio hp, and viscosity {$\alpha$} has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written in terms of a single parameter K=\{\{(\{\{M\}p\}/\{\{M\}*\})\}2\}hp-5\{\{{$\alpha$} \}-1\}. We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.3 MJ is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is {$\lessequivlnt$} 1/3. In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.4\{\{M\}J\}. We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.},

  abstract = {The gap formation induced by a giant planet is important in the evolution of the planet and the protoplanetary disc. We examine the gap formation by a planet with a new formulation of one-dimensional viscous discs which takes into account the deviation from Keplerian disc rotation due to the steep gradient of the surface density. This formulation enables us to naturally include the Rayleigh stable condition for the disc rotation. It is found that the derivation from Keplerian disc rotation promotes the radial angular momentum transfer and makes the gap shallower than in the Keplerian case. For deep gaps, this shallowing effect becomes significant due to the Rayleigh condition. In our model, we also take into account the propagation of the density waves excited by the planet, which widens the range of the angular momentum deposition to the disc. The effect of the wave propagation makes the gap wider and shallower than the case with instantaneous wave damping. With these shallowing effects, our one-dimensional gap model is consistent with the recent hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract = {A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk creates a gap. This process is important for both theory and observation. Using results of a survey for a wide parameter range with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we constructed an empirical formula for the gap structure (i.e., the radial surface density distribution), which can reproduce the gap width and depth obtained by two-dimensional simulations. This formula enables us to judge whether an observed gap is likely to be caused by an embedded planet or not. The propagation of waves launched by the planet is closely connected to the gap structure. It makes the gap wider and shallower as compared with the case where an instantaneous wave damping is assumed. The hydrodynamic simulations show that the waves do not decay immediately at the launching point of waves, even when the planet is as massive as Jupiter. Based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations, we also obtained an empirical model of wave propagation and damping in cases of deep gaps. The one-dimensional gap model with our wave propagation model is able to reproduce the gap structures in hydrodynamic simulations well. In the case of a Jupiter-mass planet, we also found that the waves with a smaller wavenumber (e.g., m = 2) are excited and transport the angular momentum to a location far away from the planet. The wave with m = 2 is closely related with a secondary wave launched by a site opposite from the planet.},

  abstract = {A large planet orbiting a star in a protoplanetary disk opens a density gap along its orbit due to the strong disk-planet interaction and migrates with the gap in the disk. It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet migrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration. However, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that, in general, the gap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical model is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this reason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out the two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have found that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface density at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the surface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model developed in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of the migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the results given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other researchers. Our model easily explains why the migration speed of the gap-opening planets can be faster than the viscous gas drift speed. It can also predict the planet mass at which the type I migration is no longer adequate due to the gap development in the disk, providing a gap formation criterion based on planetary migration.},

  abstract = {Context. Young circumstellar disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their study is of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of an embedded young planet and search for disk structures that may be the result of disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We analyse new and archival near-infrared images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo, and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging and angular differential imaging modes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas ( 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. The luminosity of the detected object is consistent with that of an L-type dwarf, but its IR colours are redder, possibly indicating the presence of warm surrounding material. Further, we confirm the detection of a large gap of 54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than 17 au in radius, and its position angle is consistent with that of the outer disk. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which is different at different wavelengths and may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The detection of a young protoplanet within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 opens the door to a so far observationally unexplored parameter space of planetary formation and evolution.

  abstract = {In this paper we present the global baroclinic instability as a source for vigorous turbulence leading to angular momentum transport in Keplerian accretion disks. We show by analytical considerations and three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, in particular, protoplanetary disks have a negative radial entropy gradient, which makes them baroclinic. Two-dimensional numerical simulations show that a baroclinic flow is unstable and produces turbulence. These findings are tested for numerical effects by performing a simulation with a barotropic initial condition, which shows that imposed turbulence rapidly decays. The turbulence in baroclinic disks transports angular momentum outward and creates a radially inward-bound accretion of matter. Potential energy is released, and excess kinetic energy is dissipated. Finally, the reheating of the gas supports the radial entropy gradient, forming a self-consistent process. We measure accretion rates in our two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of M=-10-9 to -10-7 Msolar yr-1 and viscosity parameters of {$\alpha$}=10-4 to 10-2, which fit perfectly together and agree reasonably with observations. The turbulence creates pressure waves, Rossby waves, and vortices in the (R, {$\varphi$})-plane of the disk. We demonstrate in a global simulation that these vortices tend to form out of little background noise and to be long-lasting features, which have already been suggested to lead to the formation of planets.},

The hydrodynamic equations for a flat, two-dimensional, non-self-gravitating protostellar accretion disc with an embedded, Jupiter-sized protoplanet on a circular orbit are solved. To simulate possible accretion of mass on to the protoplanet we continually remove mass from the interior of the planet's Roche lobe, which is monitored. First, it is shown that consistent results independent of numerical issues (such as boundary or initial conditions, artificial viscosity or resolution) can be obtained. Then, a detailed parameter study delineates the influence of the disc viscosity and pressure on the magnitude of the accretion rate. We find that, even after the formation of a gap in the disc, the planet is still able to accrete more mass from the disc. This accretion occurs from regions of the disc that are radially exterior and interior to the planet's orbital radius. The rate depends on the magnitude of the viscosity and vertical thickness of the disc. For a disc viscosity alpha=10\^-3 and vertical thickness H/r=0.05 we estimate the time-scale for the accumulation of one Jupiter mass to be of the order of a hundred thousand years. For a larger (smaller) viscosity and disc thickness this accretion rate is increasing (decreasing). For a very small viscosity alpha5x10\^-4 the mass accretion rate through the gap on to the planet is markedly reduced, and the corresponding accretion time-scale becomes larger than the viscous evolution time of the disc.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present calculations of the linear response of a flat gaseous disk to the presence of an embedded protoplanet. The calculations are numerical and take into account terms neglected by analytic theory and also examine the effects of gradients in surface density and sound speed in the disk. We have also developed a means of rapid calculation of Laplace coefficients for a softened potential (or for a disk of nonzero height). In general, the classical analytic theory is confirmed. However, the magnitude of calculated torque due to the corotation resonance disagrees with previously derived analytical results. The calculated corotation torque is smaller than the analytic value, is much less sensitive to the value of the perturbing potential at corotation, and falls off more rapidly as a function of the azimuthal wavenumber m. It is possible that the rapid variation of the perturbing potential near corotation is responsible for this behavior. We find that the dominant effect of a pressure gradient is to increase the net torque, due to the inward displacement of the Lindblad resonances. The effect countervails the opposing effect of a gradient in disk surface density, in general. We have calculated the inferred orbital evolution timescales for the Earth and outer planets for a variety of model nebulae. In general the orbital evolution timescale for the Earth is on the order of 10 6 years. Timescales for the outer planets are much shorter: 10 3-10 4 years in general. Although the effects of the reaction of the solar nebula to the torques have been neglected in our calculations, the results indicate the importance of the protoplanets for the later stages of nebular evolution.},

We present the analytic theory that describes the linear growth phase of the instability supplemented with a survey of numerical simulations that aim to capture the nonlinear evolution. We emphasize the role of thermodynamics and large-scale infall in controlling the outcome of the instability. Despite apparent controversies in the literature, we show a remarkable level of agreement between analytic predictions and numerical results. In the next part of our review, we focus on the astrophysical consequences of the instability. We show that the disks most likely to be gravitationally unstable are young and relatively massive compared with their host star, M\textsubscript{d}/M\textsubscript{*}{$\geq$}0.1. They will develop quasi-stable spiral arms that process infall from the background cloud. Although instability is less likely at later times, once infall becomes less important, the manifestations of the instability are more varied. In this regime, the disk thermodynamics, often regulated by stellar irradiation, dictates the development and evolution of the instability. In some cases the instability may lead to fragmentation into bound companions. These companions are more likely to be brown dwarfs or stars than planetary mass objects. Finally, we highlight open questions related to the development of a turbulent cascade in thin disks and the role of mode-mode coupling in setting the maximum angular momentum transport rate in thick disks.},

  abstract = {The radial drift problem constitutes one of the most fundamental problems in planet formation theory, as it predicts particles to drift into the star before they are able to grow to planetesimal size. Dust-trapping vortices have been proposed as a possible solution to this problem, as they might be able to trap particles over millions of years, allowing them to grow beyond the radial drift barrier. Here, we present ALMA 0.{${''}$}04 resolution imaging of the pre-transitional disk of V1247 Orionis that reveals an asymmetric ring as well as a sharply confined crescent structure, resembling morphologies seen in theoretical models of vortex formation. The asymmetric ring (at 0.{${''}$}17 = 54 au separation from the star) and the crescent (at 0.{${''}$}38 = 120 au) seem smoothly connected through a one-armed spiral-arm structure that has been found previously in scattered light. We propose a physical scenario with a planet orbiting at {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}3 {$\approx$} 100 au, where the one-armed spiral arm detected in polarized light traces the accretion stream feeding the protoplanet. The dynamical influence of the planet clears the gap between the ring and the crescent and triggers two vortices that trap millimeter-sized particles, namely, the crescent and the bright asymmetry seen in the ring. We conducted dedicated hydrodynamics simulations of a disk with an embedded planet, which results in similar spiral-arm morphologies as seen in our scattered-light images. At the position of the spiral wake and the crescent we also observe 12CO(3-2) and H12CO+ (4-3) excess line emission, likely tracing the increased scale-height in these disk regions.},

  abstract = {The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this Letter, we suggest a particle retention mechanism that promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves toward a quasi-steady state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This scenario presents a robust process for grain retention that may aid in the formation of proto-gas giant cores preferentially near the snow line.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

  abstract = {Numerical calculations of the dynamics of a spherically symmetric collapsing proto-star of one solar mass have been made for various initial conditions. Calculations have also been made for masses of 2M0 and M o. In all cases the collapse is found to be extremely non-homologous and is such that a very small part of the cloud's mass at the centre reaches stellar densities and stops collapsing before most of the cloud has had time to collapse very far. The stellar core thus formed subsequently grows in mass as material falls into it, finally becoming an ordinary star when all of the proto-stellar material has been accreted. During most of this time the stellar core is completely obscured by the dust in the infalling cloud, the absorbed radiation reappearing in the infra-red as thermal emission from the dust grains. The resulting star is almost a conventional Hayashi pre-main sequence model, but it appears rather low on the Hayashi track. For masses much greater than about 2M0 the convective Hayashi phase does not exist at all. It appears that certain properties of T Tauri stars may find explanation in the results of the present calculations. In an appendix to the paper it is shown that limiting forms may be derived for the density and velocity distributions near the centre of an isothermally collapsing sphere. This may be shown to be possible also for a sphere with a polytropic equation of state. Numerical results are presented for the limiting solution in the isothermal case.},

Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

  abstract = {Our current understanding of the physical processes of star formation is reviewed, with emphasis on processes occurring in molecular clouds like those observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density peak that evolves towards a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behaviour. The result is that a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion at a rate that is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing angular momentum and driving episodes of disk accretion. Variable accretion may account for some peculiarities of young stars such as flareups and jet production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes in very dense environments.},

  abstract = {The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program provides a detailed, high-resolution (\textasciitilde 10-20 au) view of molecular line emission in five protoplanetary disks at spatial scales relevant for planet formation. Here we present a systematic analysis of chemical substructures in 18 molecular lines toward the MAPS sources: IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. We identify more than 200 chemical substructures, which are found at nearly all radii where line emission is detected. A wide diversity of radial morphologies-including rings, gaps, and plateaus-is observed both within each disk and across the MAPS sample. This diversity in line emission profiles is also present in the innermost 50 au. Overall, this suggests that planets form in varied chemical environments both across disks and at different radii within the same disk. Interior to 150 au, the majority of chemical substructures across the MAPS disks are spatially coincident with substructures in the millimeter continuum, indicative of physical and chemical links between the disk midplane and warm, elevated molecular emission layers. Some chemical substructures in the inner disk and most chemical substructures exterior to 150 au cannot be directly linked to dust substructure, however, which indicates that there are also other causes of chemical substructures, such as snowlines, gradients in UV photon fluxes, ionization, and radially varying elemental ratios. This implies that chemical substructures could be developed into powerful probes of different disk characteristics, in addition to influencing the environments within which planets assemble.

By using the asymmetry of molecular line emission relative to the disk major axis, we infer the emission height (z) above the midplane as a function of radius (r). Using this method, we measure emitting surfaces for a suite of CO isotopologues, HCN, and C2H. We find that 12CO emission traces the most elevated regions with \$z/r 0.3\$ , while emission from the less abundant 13CO and C18O probes deeper into the disk at altitudes of \$z/r\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash,0.2\$ . C2H and HCN have lower opacities and signal-to-noise ratios, making surface fitting more difficult, and could only be reliably constrained in AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480, with \$z/r\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash,0.1\$ , i.e., relatively close to the planet-forming midplanes. We determine peak brightness temperatures of the optically thick CO isotopologues and use these to trace 2D disk temperature structures. Several CO temperature profiles and emission surfaces show dips in temperature or vertical height, some of which are associated with gaps and rings in line and/or continuum emission. These substructures may be due to local changes in CO column density, gas surface density, or gas temperatures, and detailed thermochemical models are necessary to better constrain their origins and relate the chemical compositions of elevated disk layers with those of planet-forming material in disk midplanes.

The asymmetry of line emission relative to the disk major axis allows for a direct mapping of the emission height above the midplane, and for optically-thick, spatially-resolved emission in LTE, the intensity is a measure of the local gas temperature. Our analysis of ALMA archival data yields CO emission surfaces, dynamically-constrained stellar host masses, and disk atmosphere gas temperatures for the disks around: HD 142666, MY Lup, V4046 Sgr, HD 100546, GW Lup, WaOph 6, DoAr 25, Sz 91, CI Tau, and DM Tau. These sources span a wide range in stellar masses (0.50-2.10 M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$), ages (\$\{\textbackslash sim\}\$0.3-23 Myr), and CO gas radial emission extents (\$\{\textbackslash approx\}\$200-1000 au). This sample nearly triples the number of disks with mapped emission surfaces and confirms the wide diversity in line emitting heights (\$z/r\textbackslash approx0.1\$ to \$\{rsim\}0.5\$) hinted at in previous studies. We compute radial and vertical CO gas temperature distributions for each disk. A few disks show local temperature dips or enhancements, some of which correspond to dust substructures or the proposed locations of embedded planets. Several emission surfaces also show vertical substructures, which all align with rings and gaps in the millimeter dust. Combining our sample with literature sources, we find that CO line emitting heights weakly decline with stellar mass and gas temperature, which, despite large scatter, is consistent with simple scaling relations. We also observe a correlation between CO emission height and disk size, which is due to the flared structure of disks. Overall, CO emission surfaces trace \$\{\textbackslash approx\}2\$-\$5\textbackslash times\$ gas pressure scale heights (H\$\_\{\textbackslash rm\{g\}\}\$) and could potentially be calibrated as empirical tracers of H\$\_\{\textbackslash rm\{g\}\}\$.},

Recent studies seem to indicate that dust may decouple efficiently from the gas during these early stages. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to understand how much and in which regions dust grains concentrate during the early phases of the protostellar collapse, and to see how this depends on the properties of the initial cloud and of the solid particles. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We used the multiple species dust dynamics MULTIGRAIN solver of the grid-based code RAMSES to perform various simulations of dusty collapses. We performed hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations where we varied the maximum size of the dust distribution, the thermal-to-gravitational energy ratio, and the magnetic properties of the cloud. We simulated the simultaneous evolution of ten neutral dust grain species with grain sizes varying from a few nanometers to a few hundreds of microns. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We obtain a significant decoupling between the gas and the dust for grains of typical sizes of a few tens of microns. This decoupling strongly depends on the thermal-to-gravitational energy ratio, the grain sizes, and the inclusion of a magnetic field. With a semi-analytic model calibrated on our results, we show that the dust ratio mostly varies exponentially with the initial Stokes number at a rate that depends on the local cloud properties. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: We find that larger grains tend to settle and drift efficiently in the first-core and in the newly formed disk. This can produce dust-to-gas ratios of several times the initial value. Dust concentrates in high-density regions (cores, disk, and pseudo-disk) and is depleted in low-density regions (envelope and outflows). The size at which grains decouple from the gas depends on the initial properties of the clouds. Since dust cannot necessarily be used as a proxy for gas during the collapse, we emphasize the necessity of including the treatment of its dynamics in protostellar collapse simulations.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the migration of small-mass planets in 3D radiative discs. Indeed, migration of small planets is known to be too fast inwards in locally isothermal conditions. However, thermal effects could reverse its direction, potentially saving planets in the inner, optically thick parts of the protoplanetary disc. This effect has been seen for masses larger than 5 Earth masses, but the minimum mass for this to happen has never been probed numerically, although it is of crucial importance for planet formation scenarios. We have extended the hydrodynamical code FARGO to 3D, with thermal diffusion. With this code, we perform simulations of embedded planets down to 2 Earth masses. For a set of discs' parameters for which outward migration has been shown in the range of [5, 35] Earth masses, we find that the transition to inward migration occurs for masses in the range [3, 5] Earth masses. The transition appears to be due to an unexpected phenomenon: the formation of an asymmetric cold and dense finger of gas driven by circulation and libration streamlines. We recover this phenomenon in 2D simulations where we control the cooling effects of the gas through a simple modelling of the energy equation.},

  abstract = {Sulfur-bearing molecules play an important role in prebiotic chemistry and planet habitability. They are also proposed probes of chemical ages, elemental C/O ratio, and grain chemistry processing. Commonly detected in diverse astrophysical objects, including the solar system, their distribution and chemistry remain, however, largely unknown in planet-forming disks. We present CS (2 - 1) observations at \textasciitilde 0"3 resolution performed within the ALMA MAPS Large Program toward the five disks around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. CS is detected in all five disks, displaying a variety of radial intensity profiles and spatial distributions across the sample, including intriguing apparent azimuthal asymmetries. Transitions of C2S and SO were also serendipitously covered, but only upper limits are found. For MWC 480, we present complementary ALMA observations at \textasciitilde{} 0"5 of CS, 13CS, C34S, H2CS, OCS, and SO2. We find a column density ratio N(H2CS)/N(CS) \textasciitilde{} 2/3, suggesting that a substantial part of the sulfur reservoir in disks is in organic form (i.e., CxHySz). Using astrochemical disk modeling tuned to MWC 480, we demonstrate that N(CS)/N(SO) is a promising probe for the elemental C/O ratio. The comparison with the observations provides a supersolar C/O. We also find a depleted gas-phase S/H ratio, suggesting either that part of the sulfur reservoir is locked in solid phase or that it remains in an unidentified gas-phase reservoir. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.},

  abstract = {The gas-rich protoplanetary disks around nearby young stars are regions of active planet formation. Recently, the presence of young planets in protoplanetary disks has been inferred by identifying deviations from Keplerian rotation in spatially resolved maps of spectral line emission. Debris disks around slightly older main sequence stars occasionally have sufficient quantities of gas to allow for a similar study of disk kinematics at comparable spatial and spectral resolution. Here we apply the methodology used to infer the presence of planets in protoplanetary disks \textemdash{} via signatures like velocity kinks and Doppler flips \textemdash{} to the debris disk around the nearby A star 49 Ceti. We search for localized velocity kinks within channel maps and Doppler Flips in the residuals of intensity-weighted velocity (first moment) maps. Using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we first verified the presence of velocity kinks and Doppler Flips in the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296, using 12CO(J=2-1) at an angular resolution 0.04" (linear resolution 5 au). We then analyzed CI(3P1-3P0) (angular resolution 0.25", linear resolution 14 au) and 12CO(J=3-2) emission data (angular resolution 0.13", linear resolution 8 au) for the gas-rich debris disk of 49 Ceti, which did not show any clear velocity kinks/wiggles. However, disk models do indicate moderate evidence of a warp in the disk, a possibility considered in previous studies. Our analysis rules out gas giant planets orbiting 49 Ceti with semimajor axes between 60 and 260 au, and provides proof of concept for similar studies of a wider variety of debris disks in the future.},

  abstract = {The formation of stars and planets are connected through disks. Our theoretical understanding of disk formation has undergone drastic changes in recent years, and we are on the brink of a revolution in disk observation enabled by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Large rotationally supported circumstellar disks, although common around more evolved young stellar objects (YSOs), are rarely detected during the earliest, "class 0" phase; however, a few excellent candidates have been discovered recently around both low- and high-mass protostars. In this early phase, prominent outflows are ubiquitously observed; they are expected to be associated with at least small magnetized disks. Whether the paucity of large Keplerian disks is due to observational challenges or intrinsically different properties of the youngest disks is unclear. In this review, we focus on the observations and theory of the formation of early disks and outflows and their connections with the first phases of planet formation. Disk formation \textemdash{} once thought to be a simple consequence of the conservation of angular momentum during hydrodynamic core collapse \textemdash{} is far more subtle in magnetized gas. In this case, the rotation can be strongly magnetically braked. Indeed, both analytic arguments and numerical simulations have shown that disk formation is suppressed in the strict ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit for the observed level of core magnetization. We review what is known about this "magnetic braking catastrophe," possible ways to resolve it, and the current status of early disk observations. Possible resolutions include non-ideal MHD effects (ambipolar diffusion, Ohmic dissipation, and the Hall effect), magnetic interchange instability in the inner part of protostellar accretion flow, turbulence, misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis, and depletion of the slowly rotating envelope by outflow stripping or accretion. Outflows are also intimately linked to disk formation; they are a natural product of magnetic fields and rotation and are important signposts of star formation. We review new developments on early outflow generation since Protostars and Planets V (Reipurth et al., 2007). The properties of early disks and outflows are a key component of planet formation in its early stages and we review these major connections.},

We detect several bright blobs at {$\sim$}180 mas separation from the star, and a faint arc-like structure in the IFS data. Our reference differential imaging (RDI) data analysis also finds a bright ring at the same separation. We show, using a simulation based on polarized light data, that these blobs are actually part of the ring at 180 mas. These results demonstrate that the earlier detections of blobs in the H and KS bands at these separations in Biller et al. as potential planet/substellar companions are actually tracing a bright ring with a Keplerian motion. Moreover, we detect in the images an additional bright structure at {$\sim$}93 mas separation and position angle of 355\textdegree, at a location very close to previous detections. It appears point-like in the YJ and K bands but is more extended in the H band. We also marginally detect an inner ring in the RDI data at {$\sim$}100 mas. Follow-up observations are necessary to confirm the detection and the nature of this source and structure.},

We summarize recent progress in theoretical investigations of the disk-companion tidal interaction. We show that low-mass protoplanets excite density waves at their Lindblad resonances and that these waves are likely to be dissipated locally. When a protoplanet acquires sufficient mass, its tidal torque induces the formation of a gap in the vicinity of its orbit. Gap formation leads to the termination of protoplanetary growth by accretion. For proto-Jupiter to attain its present mass, we require that (1) the primordial solar nebula is heated by viscous dissipation; (2) the viscous evolution time scale of the nebula is comparable to the age of typical T Tauri stars with circumstellar disks; and (3) the mass distribution in the nebula is comparable to that estimated from a minimum-mass nebula model.},

Although several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the origin of such rings, a common explanation is that they trace new-born planets. Under the planetary hypothesis, a natural question is how to reconcile the apparently high frequency of gap-carving planets at 10-100 au with the paucity of Jupiter-mass planets observed around main-sequence stars at those separations. Here, we provide an analysis of the new-born planet population emerging from observations of gaps in discs, under the assumption that the observed gaps are due to planets. We use a simple estimate of the planet mass based on the gap morphology, and apply it to a sample of gaps recently obtained by us in a survey of Taurus with ALMA. We also include additional data from recent published surveys, thus analysing the largest gap sample to date, for a total of 48 gaps. The properties of the purported planets occupy a distinctively different region of parameter space with respect to the known exo-planet population, currently not accessible through planet finding methods. Thus, no discrepancy in the mass and radius distribution of the two populations can be claimed at this stage. We show that the mass of the inferred planets conforms to the theoretically expected trend for the minimum planet mass needed to carve a dust gap. Finally, we estimate the separation and mass of the putative planets after accounting for migration and accretion, for a range of evolutionary times, finding a good match with the distribution of cold Jupiters.},

This subsample of disks is selected from a high-resolution ({$\sim$}0.{${''}$}12) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus star-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of brightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While axisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and high-contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to the visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings, the flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust substructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness. Disks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The correlation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between rings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if most gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the condition of low disk turbulence ({$\alpha$} = 10-4). The gap locations are not well correlated with the expected locations of CO and N2 ice lines, so condensation fronts are unlikely to be a universal mechanism to create gaps and rings, though they may play a role in some cases.},

Such systems are characterized by the presence of a spiral pattern that can be either in a quasi-steady state or in a nonlinear unstable condition. This spiral wave affects both the gas dynamics and kinematics, resulting in deviations from the Keplerian rotation. Recently, a lot of attention has been devoted to kinematic studies of planet-forming environments, and we are now able to measure even small perturbations of velocity field ({$\lessequivlnt$}1\% of the Keplerian speed) thanks to high spatial and spectral resolution observations of protostellar disks. In this work, we investigate the kinematic signatures of gravitational instability: we perform an analytical study of the linear response of a self-gravitating disk to a spiral-like perturbation, focusing our attention on the velocity field perturbations. We show that unstable disks have clear kinematic imprints into the gas component across the entire disk extent, due to the GI spiral wave perturbation, resulting in deviations from Keplerian rotation. The shape of these signatures depends on several parameters, but they are significantly affected by the cooling factor: by detecting these features, we can put constraints on protoplanetary disk cooling.},

We consider in detail the special case where there is a local maximum in the disk entropy profile S(r). This maximum acts to trap the waves in its vicinity if its height-to-width ratio max(S)/{$\Delta$}r is larger than a threshold value. The pressure gradient derived from this entropy variation provides the restoring force for the wave growth. We show that the trapped waves act to transport angular momentum outward. A plausible way to produce an entropy variation is when an accretion disk is starting from negligible mass and temperature, therefore, negligible entropy. As mass accumulates by either tidal torquing, magnetic torquing, or Roche-lobe overflow, confinement of heat will lead to an entropy maximum at the outer boundary of the disk. Possible nonlinear developments from this instability include the formation of Rossby vortices and the formation of spiral shocks. What remains to be determined from hydrodynamic simulations is whether or not Rossby wave packets (or vortices) ``hold together'' as they propagate radially inward.},

Inwardly propagating g-modes become increasingly focused toward the disk midplane, experience a rapidly decreasing radial group velocity, and increasing perturbing velocities near the disk midplane. Such waves can never reach the disk radial center and must almost certainly shock near midplane.},

  abstract = {We analyze the linear, three-dimensional response to tidal forcing of a disk that is thin and thermally stratified in the direction normal to the disk plane. We model the vertical disk structure locally as a polytrope that represents a disk of high optical depth. We solve the three-dimensional gasdynamics equations semianalytically in the neighborhood of a Lindblad resonance. These solutions match asymptotically onto those valid away from resonances (previously obtained by Korycansky \& Pringle) and provide solutions valid at all radii r. We obtain the following results: (1) A variety of waves are launched at the resonance, including r-modes and g-modes. However, the f-mode carries more than 95\% of the torque exerted at the resonance. (2) These three-dimensional waves collectively transport exactly the amount of angular momentum predicted by the standard two-dimensional resonant torque formula. (3) Near resonance, the f-mode behaves compressibly and occupies the full vertical extent of the disk. Away from resonance, the f-mode behaves incompressibly, becomes confined near the surface of the disk, and, in the absence of other dissipation mechanisms, damps via shocks. In general, the radial length scale for this process is roughly rL/m (for resonant radius rL and azimuthal tidal forcing wavenumber m), independent of the disk thickness H. This wave-channeling process is due to the variations of physical quantities in r and is not due to wave refraction. (4) However, the inwardly propagating f-mode launched from an m = 2 inner Lindblad resonance experiences relatively minor channeling (accompanied by about a factor of 5 increase in nonlinearity), all the way to the radial center of the disk. We conclude that for binary stars, tidally generated waves at Lindblad resonances in highly optically thick circumbinary disks are subject to strong nonlinear damping by the channeling mechanism, while those in circumstellar accretion disks are subject to weaker nonlinear effects. We also apply our results to waves excited by young planets for which m \textasciitilde{} r/H and conclude that the waves are likely damped on the scale of a few H.},

The planet is assumed to be in a circular orbit around the central star and is not allowed to migrate. A gap is formed about the orbit of the planet, but there is a nonaxisymmetric flow through the gap and onto the planet. The gap partitions the disk into an inner (outer) disk that extends inside (outside) the planet's orbit. For a 1 MJ planet and typical disk parameters, the accretion through the gap onto the planet is highly efficient. That is, the rate is comparable to the accretion rate toward the central star that would occur in the absence of the planet (at the location of the planet). For typical disk parameters, the mass-doubling timescale is less than 105 yr, considerably shorter than the disk lifetime. Following shocks near the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points, disk material enters the Roche lobe in the form of two gas streams. Shocks occur within the Roche lobe as the gas streams collide, and shocks lead to rapid inflow toward the planet within much of planet's Roche lobe. Shocks also propagate in the inner and outer disks that orbit the star. For higher mass planets (of order 6 MJ), the flow rate onto the planet is considerably reduced, which suggests an upper mass limit to planets in the range of 10 MJ. This rate reduction is related to the fact that the gap width increases relative to the Roche (Hill sphere) radius with increasing planetary mass. The flow in the gap affects planetary migration. For the 1 MJ planet case, mass can penetrate from the outer disk to the inner disk, so that the inner disk is not depleted. The results suggest that most of the mass in gas giant planets is acquired by flows through gaps.},

We describe an analytic linear model for this interaction. We adopt a simplified model involving azimuthal forcing that produces the resonance and permits an analytic description of its structure. We derive an analytic expression for the buoyancy torque and show that the vertical torque distribution agrees well with the results of the Athena simulations and a Fourier method for linear numerical calculations carried out with the same forcing. The buoyancy resonance differs from the classic Lindblad and corotation resonances in that the resonance lies along tilted planes. Its width depends on damping effects and is independent of the gas sound speed. The resonance does not excite propagating waves. At a given large azimuthal wavenumber ky {$>$} h -1 (for disk thickness h), the buoyancy resonance exerts a torque over a region that lies radially closer to the corotation radius than the Lindblad resonance. Because the torque is localized to the region of excitation, it is potentially subject to the effects of nonlinear saturation. In addition, the torque can be reduced by the effects of radiative heat transfer between the resonant region and its surroundings. For each azimuthal wavenumber, the resonance establishes a large scale density wave pattern in a plane within the disk.},

By combining these measurements with previous observations with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph and other facilities, we have classified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of circumstellar disks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). Through these classifications, we find that the disk fraction in Taurus, N(II)/N(II+III), is \textasciitilde 75\% for solar-mass stars and declines to \textasciitilde 45\% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (0.01-0.3 M sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that measured for Chamaeleon I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher overall, probably because of its younger age (1 Myr versus 2-3 Myr). In comparison, the disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (\textasciitilde 20\%) in IC 348 and {$\sigma$} Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Chamaeleon I and are roughly coeval with the latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in star-forming regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of Spitzer photometry that are available for \textasciitilde 200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-infrared (mid-IR) variability than diskless stars, which agrees with the results of similar variability measurements for a smaller sample of stars in Chamaeleon I. The variability fraction for stars with disks is higher in Taurus than in Chamaeleon I, indicating that the IR variability of disks decreases with age. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the observational criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The ratio of the number of evolved and transitional disks to the number of primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for spectral types of K5-M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 \texttimes{} {$\tau$}primordial \textasciitilde{} 0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters and associations (2-10 Myr) that have been observed with Spitzer, we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account. Based on observations performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope.},

Viscous dissipation in this disc will cause it to shine with a luminosity greater than the final main sequence star for a period of io yr or so. Most of the properties of T Tauri stars can be explained as a consequence of disc evolution. Flares in Flare stars are interpreted as the entry of blobs of an old disc into the late type stellar atmospheres. On this hypothesis flaring activity could be observed in M stars of up to 5 x io yr old, and planetary systems will be common.

Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that are leading to new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence on stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in {$\sim$}1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. We recalculated the disk masses using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low-mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found by converting the measured planet masses into heavy element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (\&lt;0.1-1 Myr) and a large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished by fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

  abstract = {We use well-established observational evidence to draw conclusions about the fundamental nature of the viscosity in accretion discs. To do this, we first summarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless accretion disc viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}, defined by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of {$\alpha$} is readily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are consistent with the hypothesis that {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 0.2 - 0.3 . In contrast in discs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of {$\alpha$} are generally less direct and the values obtained are generally {$<$} 0.01 and often {$\ll$} 0.01. We conclude that this gives us crucial information about the nature of viscosity in accretion discs. First, in fully ionized discs the strength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic. This implies that it is necessary that credible models of the turbulence reflect this fact. Second, the smaller values of {$\alpha$} found for less ionized, and therefore less strongly conducting, discs imply that magnetism plays a dominant role. This provides important observational support for the concept of magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven hydromagnetic turbulence.},

When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, the main effect of thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the planet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes on either side of the orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes exert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to the one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the lobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the 'cold' thermal torque, which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the distance to corotation to the size of the lobes {$\sim\surd\lbrace\chi$} /{$\Omega$} \_p\vphantom\{\}, {$\chi$} being the thermal diffusivity and {$\Omega$}p the orbital frequency. We believe that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named 'cold finger' recently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes the dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is luminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional disturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes. They give a torque, named heating torque in previous work, that has an expression similar, but of opposite sign, to the cold thermal torque.},

The key dynamical processes involved in star formation\textemdash turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity\textemdash are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

  abstract = {We present simulations of low-mass planet-disc interactions in inviscid three-dimensional discs. We show that a wind-driven laminar accretion flow through the surface layers of the disc does not significantly modify the migration torque experienced by embedded planets. More importantly, we find that 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the dynamical corotation torque compared to earlier 2D theory and simulations. Although it was previously shown that the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow and essentially stall the inward migration of a low-mass planet, our results in 3D show that the dynamical corotation torque has the complete opposite effect and speeds up inward migration. Our numerical experiments implicate buoyancy resonances as the cause. These have two effects: (I) they exert a direct torque on the planet, whose magnitude relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in our simulations to be small; (II) they torque the gas librating on horseshoe orbits in the corotation region and drive evolution of its vortensity, leading to the negative dynamical corotation torque. This indicates that at low turbulent viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure of the protoplanetary disc plays an important role in determining the migration behaviour of embedded planets. If this result holds up under a more refined treatment of disc thermal evolution, then it has important implications for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {It has been recently suggested that the multiple concentric rings and gaps discovered by ALMA in many protoplanetary disks may be produced by a single planet, as a result of the complex propagation and dissipation of the multiple spiral density waves it excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to verify this idea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with a prescribed disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this approximation does not provide an accurate description of the density wave dynamics on scales of tens of astronomical units. Moreover, we show that locally isothermal simulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well as misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the energy equation is evolved explicitly. This outcome is caused by the nonconservation of the angular momentum flux of linear perturbations in locally isothermal disks. We demonstrate this effect using simulations of locally isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially identical temperature profiles) and show how the dust distributions, probed by millimeter wavelength observations, differ between the two cases. Locally isothermal simulations may thus underestimate the masses of planets responsible for the formation of multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of astronomical units observed by ALMA. We suggest that caution should be exercised in using the locally isothermal simulations to explore planet-disk interaction, as well as in other studies of wave-like phenomena in astrophysical disks.},

We reassess the origin of multiple arms in the framework of linear theory by solving for the global two-dimensional response of a nonbarotropic disk to an orbiting planet. We show that the formation of a secondary arm in the inner disk, at about half of the orbital radius of the planet, is a robust prediction of linear theory. This arm becomes stronger than the primary spiral at several tenths of the orbital radius of the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also form in the inner disk. On the contrary, a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to form in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting for the global behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally support the recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin (as caused by the intricacy of constructive interference of the azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation at different radii). We provide analytical arguments showing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into multiple arms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating disks. It is not unique to planet-driven waves and also occurs in linear calculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with no external torques. These results are relevant for understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {Context. Pebble accretion is expected to be the dominant process for the formation of massive solid planets, such as the cores of giant planets and super-Earths. So far, this process has been studied under the assumption that dust coagulates and drifts throughout the full protoplanetary disk. However, observations show that many disks are structured in rings that may be due to pressure maxima, preventing the global radial drift of the dust. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to study how the pebble-accretion paradigm changes if the dust is confined in a ring. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: Our approach is mostly analytic. We derived a formula that provides an upper bound to the growth of a planet as a function of time. We also numerically implemented the analytic formul\ae{} to compute the growth of a planet located in a typical ring observed in the DSHARP survey, as well as in a putative ring rescaled at 5 AU. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Planet Type I migration is stopped in a ring, but not necessarily at its center. If the entropy-driven corotation torque is desaturated, the planet is located in a region with low dust density, which severely limits its accretion rate. If the planet is instead near the ring's center, its accretion rate can be similar to the one it would have in a classic (ringless) disk of equivalent dust density. However, the growth rate of the planet is limited by the diffusion of dust in the ring, and the final planet mass is bounded by the total ring mass. The DSHARP rings are too far from the star to allow the formation of massive planets within the disk's lifetime. However, a similar ring rescaled to 5 AU could lead to the formation of a planet incorporating the full ring mass in less than 1/2 My. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The existence of rings may not be an obstacle to planet formation by pebble-accretion. However, for accretion to be effective, the resting position of the planet has to be relatively near the ring's center, and the ring needs to be not too far from the central star. The formation of planets in rings can explain the existence of giant planets with core masses smaller than the so-called pebble isolation mass.},

This is seemingly at odds with the radial-velocity discovery of CI Tau b, a {$\sim$}12 M J planet at {$\sim$}0.1 au, which would be expected to carve a wide, deep cavity in the innermost disk. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we run 2D hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of the planet on the disk, then post-process the results with radiative transfer to obtain an SED. We find that at {$\sim$}0.1 au, even such a massive companion has little impact on the NIR excess, a result that holds regardless of planetary eccentricity and dust size distribution. Conversely, the observed full-disk signature in CI Tau's SED is consistent with the existence of the hot super-Jupiter CI Tau b. As our simulations uncover, clear transition-disk signatures in SEDs are more likely to be signposts of nascent ``warm'' Jupiters, located at around 1 au in the future habitable zones of their host stars.},

Using 3D hydrodynamics with {$\beta$} cooling to a vertically stratified background, as well as radiative-transfer modeling, we investigate the temperature rise in planet-driven spirals. In rapidly cooling disks, the temperature rise is dominated by a contribution from stellar irradiation, 0.3\%-3\% inside the planet radius but always {$<$} 0.5\% outside. When cooling time equals or exceeds dynamical time, however, this is overwhelmed by hydrodynamic PdV work, which introduces a \textasciitilde 10\%-20\% perturbation within a factor of \textasciitilde 2 from the planet's orbital radius. We devise an empirical fit of the spiral amplitude \$\{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash Delta \}\}\{(T)=(\{M\}\_\{p\}/\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\})\}\^\{c\}(\{f\}\_\{\{PdV\}\}\{e\}\^\{-\{t\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{arm\}\}/\{t\}\_\{c\}\}+\{f\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{rad\}\})\$ to take into account both effects. Where cooling is slow, we find also that temperature perturbations from buoyancy spirals-a strictly 3D, nonisothermal phenomenon-become nearly as strong as those from Lindblad spirals, which are amenable to 2D and isothermal studies.

We reexamine settling and growth of dust particles in the subsequent laminar phase of the solar nebula in detail, treating a dust layer as a two-component fluid composed of the dust and the gas. We obtain analytic expressions for the settling path, the growing size, and the settling time. The settling process is divided into two phases, i.e., an early gas-dominant phase and a later dust-dominant phase. So far, only the former phase, where the particle path finally turns from vertical to radial, has been investigated. In the latter phase, dust particles drag the gas, rather than the gas does dust particles. Consequently, the particle path turns from radial to vertical. Dust particles grow most appreciably and rapidly in a radially sweeping phase. The final radii of dust particles at the onset of gravitational instability of the dust layer are 20, 5.9, and 0.60 cm in the Earth's, Jupiter's, and Neptune's zones, respectively. These values are much smaller than those obtained previously by S.J. Weidenschilling [1980, Icarus44, 172-189] and Y. Nakagawa et al. [1981, Icarus45, 517-528]. The total settling times are 1.9 \texttimes{} 10 3, 4.6 \texttimes{} 10 3, and 2.8 \texttimes{} 10 4 years in the above-mentioned three zones, respectively.

  abstract = {We present a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a turbulent accretion disc interacting with a giant protoplanet of 5 Jupiter masses in a fixed circular orbit. The disc model had an aspect ratio H/r= 0.1, and in the absence of the protoplanet a typical value of the Shakura-Sunyaev stress parameter {$\alpha$}= 5 \texttimes{} 10-3. As expected from previous work, the protoplanet was found to open and maintain a significant gap in the disc, with the interaction leading to inward migration of the protoplanet orbit on the expected time-scale. No evidence for a persistent net mass flow through the gap was found. However, this may be because an extensive inner cavity could not be formed for the model adopted. Spiral waves were launched by the protoplanet and, although these appeared to be diffused and dissipated through interaction with the turbulence, they produced an outward angular momentum flow which compensated for a reduced flux associated with the MHD turbulence near the planet, so maintaining the gap. When compared with laminar disc models, with the same estimated {$\alpha$} in the absence of the planet, the gap was found to be deeper and wider, indicating that the turbulent disc behaved as if it in fact possessed a smaller {$\alpha$}, even though analysis of the turbulent stress indicated that it was not significantly affected by the planet in the region away from the gap. This may arise for two reasons. First, unlike a Navier-Stokes viscosity with anomalous viscosity coefficient, the turbulence does not provide a source of constantly acting friction in the near vicinity of the planet that leads to steady mass flow into the gap region. Instead, the turbulence is characterized by large fluctuations in the radial velocity, and time averaging of these fluctuations over significant time-scales is required to recover the underlying mass flow through the disc. In the vicinity of the planet, the disc material experiences high amplitude periodic perturbations on time-scales that are short relative to the time-scale required for averaging. Consequently the disc response is likely to be significantly altered relative to that expected from a Navier-Stokes model. Secondly, the simulation indicates that an ordered magnetic connection between the inner and outer disc can occur enabling angular momentum to flow out across the gap, helping to maintain it independently of the protoplanet's tide. This type of effect may assist gap formation for smaller mass protoplanets which otherwise would not be able to maintain them. There is also some evidence that magnetic connection between the circumstellar disc and material that flows into the protoplanet's Hill sphere may lead to significant magnetic braking of the resulting circumplanetary disc, thereby modifying the expected gas accretion rate on to forming gas giant planets.},

  abstract = {We present the results of global cylindrical disc simulations and local shearing box simulations of protoplanets interacting with a disc undergoing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The specific emphasis of this paper is to examine and quantify the magnitude of the torque exerted by the disc on the embedded protoplanets as a function of the protoplanet mass, and thus to make a first study of the induced orbital migration of protoplanets resulting from their interaction with magnetic, turbulent discs. This issue is of crucial importance in understanding the formation of gas giant planets through the so-called core instability model, and the subsequent orbital evolution post-formation prior to the dispersal of the protostellar disc. Current estimates of the migration time of protoplanetary cores in the 3-30 Earth mass range in standard disc models are {$\tau$}mig\textasciitilde = 104-105 yr, which is much shorter than the estimated gas accretion time-scale of Jupiter-type planets. The global simulations were carried out for a disc with constant aspect ratio H/r= 0.07 and protoplanet masses of Mp= 3, 10, 30 Earth masses, and 3 Jupiter masses. The local shearing box simulations were carried out for values of the dimensionless parameter (Mp/M*)/(H/R)3= 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0, with M*, R and H being the central mass, the orbital radius and the local disc semithickness, respectively. These allow both embedded and gap-forming protoplanets for which the disc response is non-linear to be investigated. In all cases the instantaneous net torque experienced by a protoplanet showed strong fluctuations on an orbital time-scale, and in the low-mass embedded cases oscillated between negative and positive values. Consequently, in contrast to the laminar disc type I migration scenario, orbital migration would occur as a random walk. Running time averages for embedded protoplanets over typical run times of 20-25 orbital periods indicated that the averaged torques from the inner and outer disc took on values characteristic of type I migration. However, large fluctuations occurring on longer than orbital time-scales remained, preventing convergence of the average torque to well-defined values or even to a well-defined sign for these lower mass cases. Fluctuations became relatively smaller for larger masses indicating better convergence properties, to the extent that in the 30-M{$\oplus$} simulation consistently inward, albeit noisy, migration was indicated. Both the global and local simulations showed this trend with increasing protoplanet mass, which is due to its perturbation on the disc increasing to become comparable to and then dominate the turbulence in its neighbourhood. The turbulence then becomes unable to produce very large long-term fluctuations in the torques acting on the protoplanet. Eventually gap formation occurs and there is a transition to the usual type II migration at a rate determined by the angular momentum transport in the distant parts of the disc. The existence of significant fluctuations occurring in the turbulent discs on long time-scales is an important unexplored issue for the lower mass embedded protoplanets, which are unable to modify the turbulence in their neighbourhood, and which have been studied here. If significant fluctuations occur on the longest disc evolutionary time-scales, convergence of torque running averages for practical purposes will not occur and the migration behaviour of low-mass protoplanets considered as an ensemble will be very different from predictions of type I migration theory for laminar discs. The fact that noise levels were relatively smaller in the local simulations may indicate the presence of long-term global fluctuations, but the issue remains an important one for future investigation.},

  abstract = {We analyse the stability and non-linear dynamics of power-law accretion disc models. These have mid-plane densities that follow radial power laws and have either temperature or entropy distributions that are strict power-law functions of cylindrical radius, R. We employ two different hydrodynamic codes to perform high-resolution 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations that examine the long-term evolution of the disc models as a function of the power-law indices of the temperature or entropy, the disc scaleheight, the thermal relaxation time of the fluid and the disc viscosity. We present an accompanying stability analysis of the problem, based on asymptotic methods, that we use to guide our interpretation of the simulation results. We find that axisymmetric disc models whose temperature or entropy profiles cause the equilibrium angular velocity to vary with height are unstable to the growth of perturbations whose most obvious character is modes with horizontal and vertical wavenumbers that satisfy |kR/kZ| {$\gg$} 1. Instability occurs only when the thermodynamic response of the fluid is isothermal, or the thermal evolution time is comparable to or shorter than the local dynamical time-scale. These discs appear to exhibit the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke or `vertical shear' linear instability. Closer inspection of the simulation results uncovers the growth of two distinct modes. The first are characterized by very short radial wavelength perturbations that grow rapidly at high latitudes in the disc, and descend down towards the mid-plane on longer time-scales. We refer to these as `finger modes' because they display kR/kZ {$\gg$} 1. The second appear at slightly later times in the main body of the disc, including near the mid-plane. These `body modes' have somewhat longer radial wavelengths. Early on they manifest themselves as fundamental breathing modes, but quickly become corrugation modes as symmetry about the mid-plane is broken. The corrugation modes are a prominent feature of the non-linear saturated state, leading to strong vertical oscillation of the disc mid-plane. In a viscous disc with aspect ratio H/r = 0.05, instability is found to operate when the viscosity parameter {$\alpha$} {$<$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4. In three dimensions the instability generates a quasi-turbulent flow, and the associated Reynolds stress produces a fluctuating effective viscosity coefficient whose mean value reaches {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 10-3 by the end of the simulation. The evolution and saturation of the vertical shear instability in astrophysical disc models which include realistic treatments of the thermal physics has yet to be examined. Should it occur on either global or local scales, however, our results suggest that it will have significant consequences for their internal dynamics, transport properties and observational appearance.},

  abstract = {Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust- and gas-rich disks around young stars, and the outcome of this process is intimately linked to the disk chemical properties. The distributions of molecules across disks regulate the elemental compositions of planets, including C/N/O/S ratios and metallicity (O/H and C/H), as well as access to water and prebiotically relevant organics. Emission from molecules also encodes information on disk ionization levels, temperature structures, kinematics, and gas surface densities, which are all key ingredients of disk evolution and planet formation models. The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program was designed to expand our understanding of the chemistry of planet formation by exploring disk chemical structures down to 10 au scales. The MAPS program focuses on five disks-around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480-in which dust substructures are detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. We observed these disks in four spectral setups, which together cover \textasciitilde 50 lines from over 20 different species. This paper introduces the Astrophysical Journal Supplement's MAPS Special Issue by presenting an overview of the program motivation, disk sample, observational details, and calibration strategy. We also highlight key results, including discoveries of links between dust, gas, and chemical substructures, large reservoirs of nitriles and other organics in the inner disk regions, and elevated C/O ratios across most disks. We discuss how this collection of results is reshaping our view of the chemistry of planet formation.},

  abstract = {The theory of waves and instabilities in a differentially rotating disc containing a poloidal magnetic field is developed within the framework of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A continuous spectrum, for which the eigenfunctions are localized on individual magnetic surfaces, is identified but is found not to contain any instabilities associated with differential rotation. The normal modes of a weakly magnetized thin disc are studied by extending the asymptotic methods used previously to describe the equilibria. Waves propagate radially in the disc according to a dispersion relation which is determined by solving an eigenvalue problem at each radius. The dispersion relation for a hydrodynamic disc is re-examined and the modes are classified according to their behaviour in the limit of large wavenumber. The addition of a magnetic field introduces new, potentially unstable, modes and also breaks up the dispersion diagram by causing avoided crossings. The stability boundary to the magnetorotational instability in the parameter space of polytropic equilibria is located by solving directly for marginally stable equilibria. For a given vertical magnetic field in the disc, bending of the field lines has a stabilizing effect and it is shown that stable equilibria exist which are capable of launching a predominantly centrifugally driven wind.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamical model of gas in spiral and barred galaxies. Theories that have been proposed to account for the formation of spiral arms are briefly reviewed. A new model is then proposed in which both gravitational and magnetic fields are taken into consideration. In Chapter I, solutions of the basic equations for the model are obtained by using a parameter which measures the ratio of magnetic to gravitational potential energy and by making a perturbation expansion in this quantity. It is found that for appropriate initial magnetic fields, a spiral arm can be formed as a locus of the points of maximum density of gas and the symmetry of spiral arms can be explained. Noncircular motions of gas, outflow and lag in rotational velocity of gas are also discussed. The time scale for the arm formation as well as for the growth of magnetic induction in the arm is found to be of the order 2 \{\texttimes\} 10\^8 years. In Chapter II, several consequences derived from the theory are discussed. It is shown that, if a turnover point exists in the galactic rotation curve, the ring-structure as observed in some galaxies can be formed around this point, superposed on the spiral structure. To reconcile the disparity between the time scale of spiral arms and the age of galaxies, a hypothesis is made that a kind of stationarity may be established in the galactic plane, once the spiral arm is formed with the degree of winding as observed in actual galaxies, that is, angular momentum and magnetic field intensity will remain unchanged for a larger time interval than the above time scale. To test this we assume that in our Galaxy, there exists the region of instability for circular orbit inside the 3 kpc-arm that works like a pump through which mass and angular momentum of the halo flow into the disk. The supply of angular momentum by this would be sufficient of drive a large scale galactic circulation of gas, but the arguments are not conclusive. In Chapter III, a dynamical model of barred galaxies is described. The possibilities are confirmed of the outflow of gas along the bar and of the subsequent formation of trailing spiral arms at the diametral-opposite ends of the bar. It is suggested that the \texttheta -shaped barred galaxies may be transient features appearing at a late stage of the evolution sequence. The maximum life-time of barred galaxies will lie between 1 {$\sim$} 4 \{\texttimes\} 10\^9 years according to their size and the amount of gas passing through the bar per unit time.},

We also study the kinematics of the disk with 13CO and C18O ALMA observations in the J = 3-2 transition. The spiral arm morphology is recovered at all wavelengths in the dust continuum observations, where we measure contrast and spectral index variations along the spiral arms and detect subtle dust-trapping signatures. We determine that the emission from the midplane is cold and interpret the optical depth results as signatures of a disk mass higher than previous constraints. From the gas data, we search for deviations from Keplerian motion and trace the morphology of the emitting surfaces and the velocity profiles. We find an azimuthally varying emission layer height in the system, large-scale emission surrounding the disk, and strong perturbations in the channel maps, colocated with the spirals. Additionally, we develop multigrain dust and gas hydrodynamical simulations of a gravitationally unstable disk and compare them to the observations. Given the large-scale emission and highly perturbed gas structure, together with the comparison of continuum observations to theoretical predictions, we propose infall-triggered gravitational instabilities as the origin for the observed spiral structure.},

Attention is given to the situation when the surface density of the disk changes on a scale length comparable to its thickness in a gap region, of comparable dimensions, containing the protoplanet. In this case it is necessary to solve for the tidal perturbations taking the surface density structure fully into account. Expressions are developed for the angular momentum exchange rate between protoplanet and disk that require simple numerical calculations only. These calculations are undertaken for simple polytropic models of the disk. The behavior of the tidal perturbation under a wide range of assumptions about dissipation in the disk is considered, and the methods are applied to calculate the strength of the tidal torque in the limit that the protoplanet is sufficiently massive to induce a gap in the nebula.},

  abstract = {Accretion disk flow is a common phenomenon in astrophysics. It provides the nursery for planetary system formation and the channel for mass transfer in interacting binary stars. Such flows are also associated with the central engine for active galactic nuclei. Mass is redistributed in accretion disks as a consequence of angular momentum transfer. The identification of the dominant process involved is an important task in the development of accretion disk theory. Here, we review recent theoretical investigations on several important physical processes, including: 1. the removal of angular momentum from disks through hydromagnetic winds, 2. the amplification of local viscous stress through the onset of turbulence resulting from possible hydromagnetic, convective, or shear flow instabilities, 3. the transport of angular momentum carried by propagating waves, and 4. torque resulting from the presence of nonaxisymmetric unstable modes in self-gravitating and geometrically thick disks. Because of the technical nature of this subject, we present some of the mathematical formalisms in a pedagogical manner. We focus our attention on the physical discussion of the necessary conditions for each process to operate and the efficiency of angular momentum transfer to be expected. In Part II of this review, we shall present observational evidences and discuss applications of theoretical results in different astrophysical contexts.},

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers aimed at developing and interpreting simulations of protoplanets interacting with turbulent accretion discs. In this first paper we study the turbulent disc models prior to the introduction of a perturbing protoplanet. We study cylindrical disc models in which a central domain is in Keplerian rotation and unstable to the magnetorotational instability. Models of varying disc size and aspect ratio H/r are considered with magnetic fields having zero net flux. We relate the properties of the turbulent models to classical viscous disc theory. All models were found to attain a turbulent state in their Keplerian domains with volume averaged stress parameter {$\alpha\sptilde$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-3. At any particular time the vertically and azimuthally averaged value exhibited large fluctuations in radius. However, an additional time average over periods exceeding three orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain resulted in a more smoothly varying quantity with radial variations within a factor of 2 or so. The vertically and azimuthally averaged radial velocity showed much larger spatial and temporal fluctuations, requiring additional time averaging for at least seven to eight orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain to limit them. Comparison with the value derived from the averaged stress using viscous disc theory yielded schematic agreement for feasible averaging times but with some indication that the effects of residual fluctuations remained. The behaviour described above must be borne in mind when considering laminar disc simulations with anomalous Navier-Stokes viscosity. This is because the operation of a viscosity, as in classical viscous disc theory with anomalous viscosity coefficient, cannot apply to a turbulent disc undergoing rapid changes due to external perturbation. The classical theory can only be used to describe the time averaged behaviour of the parts of the disc that are in a statistically steady condition long enough for appropriate averaging to be carried out.},

  abstract = {We present the results of both global cylindrical disc simulations and local shearing box simulations of protoplanets interacting with a disc undergoing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with zero net flux magnetic fields. We investigate the nature of the disc response and conditions for gap formation. This issue is an important one for determining the type and nature of the migration of the protoplanet, with the presence of a deep gap being believed to enable slower migration. For both types of simulation we find a common pattern of behaviour for which the main parameter determining the nature of the response is MpR3/(M*H3), with Mp, M*, R and H being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the orbital radius and the local disc semi-thickness respectively. We find that as MpR3/(M*H3) is increased to \textasciitilde{} 0.1 the presence of the protoplanet is first indicated by the appearance of the well-known trailing wake which, although it may appear to be erratic on account of the turbulence, appears to be well-defined. Once MpR3/(M*H3) exceeds a number around unity, a gap starts to develop inside which the magnetic energy density tends to be concentrated in the high-density wakes. This condition for gap formation can be understood from simple dimensional considerations of the conditions for non-linearity and the balance of angular momentum transport due to Maxwell and Reynolds' stresses with that due to tidal torques applied to the parameters of our simulations. An important result is that the basic flow morphology in the vicinity of the protoplanet is very similar in both the local and global simulations. This indicates that, regardless of potentially unwanted effects arising from the periodic boundary conditions, local shearing box simulations, which are computationally less demanding, capture much of the physics of disc-planet interactions. Thus they may provide a useful tool for studying the local interaction between forming protoplanets and turbulent, protostellar discs.},

These profiles follow generally from assuming that the density variation is smooth initially.

The spherical results are given in Sections 2-4 and imply a density law proportional to r- . The planar results follow in Appendix I and the cylindrical ones in Appendix II. The solutions before the singularity arises are similarity solutions with the density and velocity profiles retaining their shapes while altering only their scales with time. Applying these results we find a spherical collapse to form a galaxy is modified by the rise in central optical depth at a density of io-20 g cm-3. Flattening instabilities are resisted but not overcome by the more rapid growth of the density gradient which occurs in a planar collapse. In Section 5, a similarity solution for the spherical collapse of an isothermal gas is presented. This has a critical point similar to those found in solar wind flows. The density profile when the singularity arises is proportional to . The collapse of a proto-star is halted by the rise in optical depth when the density reaches io-15 g cm-3. The stability of this solution and the problem of whether all flows converge to it still remain to be settled.},

Hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions predict the formation of circumplanetary disks (CPDs) around accreting planetary cores. These CPDs have eluded unequivocal detection\textemdash their identification requires predictions in CPD tracers. In this work, we aim to assess the observability of embedded CPDs with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as features imprinted in the gas kinematics. We use 3D smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of CPDs around 1 and 5 \{M\}\{Jup\} planets at large stellocentric radii in locally isothermal and adiabatic disks. The simulations are then connected with 3D radiative transfer for predictions in CO isotopologues. Observability is assessed by corrupting with realistic long baseline phase noise extracted from the recent HL Tau ALMA data. We find that the presence of a CPD produces distinct signposts: (1) a compact emission separated in velocity from the overall circumstellar disk's Keplerian pattern, (2) a strong impact on the velocity pattern when the Doppler-shifted line emission sweeps across the CPD location, and (3) a local increase in the velocity dispersion. We test our predictions with a simulation tailored for HD 100546\textemdash which has a reported protoplanet candidate. We find that the CPDs are detectable in all three signposts with ALMA Cycle 3 capabilities for both 1 and 5 \{M\}\{Jup\} protoplanets, when embedded in an isothermal disk.},

The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms.

The disk resolves into a series of concentric rings and gaps, together with a bright arc exterior to the rings that resembles hydrodynamical simulations of a vortex and a bridge-like feature connecting the two innermost rings. Although our 12CO observations at similar spatial resolution do not show obvious substructure, they reveal an inner disk depleted of CO emission. From the continuum emission and the CO velocity field we find that the innermost ring has a higher inclination than the outermost rings and the arc. This is evidence for either a small ({$\sim$}8\textdegree ) or moderate ({$\sim$}41\textdegree ) misalignment between the inner and outer disk, depending on the specific orientation of the near/far sides of the inner/outer disk. We compare the observed substructures in the ALMA observations with recent scattered-light data of this object from the Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE). In particular, the location of narrow shadow lanes in the SPHERE image, combined with pressure-scale height estimates, favor a large misalignment of about 41\textdegree.

Here we study the kinematic patterns which arise from planet-disc interactions and their observability in CO rotational emission lines.

Pressure gradients at planet-carved gaps, spiral wakes, and vortices bear strong kinematic counterparts. The isovelocity contours in the CO(2-1) line centroids v{$\odot$} reveal large-scale perturbations, corresponding to abrupt transitions from below sub-Keplerian to super-Keplerian rotation along with radial and vertical flows. The increase in line optical depth at the edge of the gap also modulates v{$\odot$}, but this is a mild effect compared to the dynamical imprint of the planet-disc interaction. The large-scale deviations from the Keplerian rotation thus allow the planets to be indirectly detected via the first moment maps of molecular gas tracers, at Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array angular resolutions. The strength of these deviations depends on the mass of the perturber. This initial study paves the way to eventually determine the mass of the planet by comparison with more detailed models.},

The high-resolution 1.3 mm continuum observation reveals fine radial and azimuthal substructures in the form of a complex maze of ridges and trenches sculpting a dust ring. The 12CO(2-1) channel maps are modulated by wiggles or kinks that deviate from Keplerian kinematics particularly over the continuum ring, where deviations span 90\textdegree{} in azimuth, covering {$\sim$}5 km s-1. The most pronounced wiggle resembles the imprint of an embedded massive planet of at least 5 MJup predicted from previous hydrodynamical simulations. Such a planet is expected to open a deep gap in both gas and dust density fields within a few orbital timescales, yet the kinematic wiggles lie near ridges in the continuum. The lesser strength of the wiggles in the 13CO and C18O isotopologues show that the kinematic signature weakens at lower disk heights, and suggests qualitatively that it is due to vertical flows in the disk surface. Within the gap, the velocity field transitions from Keplerian to strongly non-Keplerian via a twist in position angle, suggesting the presence of another perturber and/or an inner warp. We also present Very Large Telescope/SPHERE sparse aperture masking data that recover scattered light emission from the gap's edges but show no evidence for signal within the gap, discarding a stellar binary origin for its opening.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurements of the physical structure of protoplanetary discs are critical inputs for planet formation models. These constraints are traditionally established via complex modelling of continuum and line observations. Instead, we present an empirical framework to locate the CO isotopologue emitting surfaces from high spectral and spatial resolution ALMA observations. We apply this framework to the disc surrounding IM Lupi, where we report the first direct, i.e. model independent, measurements of the radial and vertical gradients of temperature and velocity in a protoplanetary disc. The measured disc structure is consistent with an irradiated self-similar disc structure, where the temperature increases and the velocity decreases towards the disc surface. We also directly map the vertical CO snow line, which is located at about one gas scale height at radii between 150 and 300 au, with a CO freeze-out temperature of 21 {$\pm$} 2 K. In the outer disc (\&gt;300 au), where the gas surface density transitions from a power law to an exponential taper, the velocity rotation field becomes significantly sub-Keplerian, in agreement with the expected steeper pressure gradient. The sub-Keplerian velocities should result in a very efficient inward migration of large dust grains, explaining the lack of millimetre continuum emission outside of 300 au. The sub-Keplerian motions may also be the signature of the base of an externally irradiated photo-evaporative wind. In the same outer region, the measured CO temperature above the snow line decreases to {$\approx$}15 K because of the reduced gas density, which can result in a lower CO freeze-out temperature, photo-desorption, or deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium.},

Most of the kinks are detected over a small range in both radial extent and velocity, suggesting a planetary origin, but for some of them foreground contamination prevents us from measuring their spatial and velocity extent. Because of the DSHARP limited spectral resolution and signal to noise in the 12CO J = 2-1 line, as well as cloud contamination, the kinks are usually detected in only one spectral channel, and will require confirmation. The strongest circumstantial evidence for protoplanets in the absence of higher spectral resolution data and additional tracers is that, upon deprojection, we find that all of the candidate planets lie within a gap and/or at the end of a spiral detected in dust continuum emission. This suggests that a significant fraction of the dust gaps and spirals observed by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in disks are caused by embedded protoplanets.},

Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and extreme adaptive optics systems have revealed that disks are dynamical systems. Most disks contain resolved structures, both in gas and dust, including rings, gaps, spirals, azimuthal dust concentrations, shadows cast by misaligned inner disks, as well as deviations from Keplerian rotation. The origin of these structures and how they relate to the planet formation process remain poorly understood. Spatially resolved kinematic studies offer a new and necessary window to understand and quantify the physical processes (turbulence, winds, radial and meridional flows, stellar multiplicity, instabilities) at play during planet formation and disk evolution. Recent progress, driven mainly by resolved ALMA observations, includes the detection and mass determination of embedded planets, the mapping of the gas flow around the accreting planets, the confirmation of tidal interactions and warped disk geometries, and stringent limits on the turbulent velocities. In this chapter, we will review our current understanding of these dynamical processes and highlight how kinematic mapping provides new ways to observe planet formation in action.},

  abstract = {The stability of spiral perturbations with an arbitrary degree of winding in gaseous astrophysical disks is studied. Simple stability criteria are obtained for localized perturbations. These criteria are formulated in terms of Toomre's stability parameter Q, which, by definition, is equal to unity at the stability boundary of radial perturbations. It turns out that to stabilize arbitrary perturbations requires that Q be greater than some critical value Q\_c, where Q\_c is considerably greater than unity; i.e., one can say that the perturbations that break the initial axial symmetry of the disk are less stable than the radial perturbations. It is shown that Q\_c is only a function of the parameter that determines the extent to which the disk rotation is differential, but it does not depend on the model that is used. In particular, for a plane rotation curve, Q\_c is a universal constant (Q\_c = square root(3)), both for an infinitely thin disk within a massive halo and for a disk of finite thickness with an arbitrary adiabatic index.},

We find excellent agreement between codes on the basic statistical properties: a slope of k-1.95 in the velocity power spectrum for hydrodynamic, Mach 10 turbulence, evidence in both codes for a Kolmogorov-like slope of k-5/3 in the variable {$\rho$}1/3 v as suggested by Kritsuk et al. and a lognormal probability distribution function (PDF) with a width that scales with the Mach number and proportionality constant b = 0.33 -0.5 in the density variance-Mach number relation. The measured structure function slopes are not converged in either code at 5123 elements. We find that for measuring volumetric statistics such as the power spectrum slope and structure function scaling, SPH and grid codes give roughly comparable results when the number of SPH particles is approximately equal to the number of grid cells. In particular, to accurately measure the power spectrum slope in the inertial range, in the absence of sub-grid turbulence models, requires at least 5123 computational elements in either code. On the other hand the SPH code was found to be better at resolving dense structures, giving maximum densities at a resolution of 1283 particles that were similar to the maximum densities resolved in the grid code at 5123 cells, reflected also in the high density tail of the PDF. We find SPH to be more dissipative at comparable numbers of computational elements in statistics of the velocity field, but correspondingly less dissipative than the grid code in the statistics of density-weighted quantities such as {$\rho$}1/3 v. For SPH simulations of high Mach number turbulence, we find it important to use sufficient non-linear {$\beta$}-viscosity in order to prevent particle interpenetration in shocks (we require {$\beta$}visc = 4 instead of the widely used default value, {$\beta$}visc = 2).},

The emission appears slightly extended with a point source component with an apparent magnitude of 13.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 mag. The position of the source coincides with a local deficit in polarization fraction in near-infrared polarimetric imaging data, which probes the surface of the well-studied circumstellar disk of HD 100546.

With this model we investigated the impact of dust gaps and gas gaps on the observables and the derived gas properties, considering chemistry, and heating and cooling processes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We find distinct peaks in the radial line intensity profiles of the CO line data of HD 163296 at the location of the dust gaps. Our model indicates that those peaks are not only a consequence of a gas temperature increase within the gaps but are mainly caused by the absorption of line emission from the back side of the disk by the dust rings. For two of the three prominent dust gaps in HD 163296, we find that thermo-chemical effects are negligible for deriving density gradients via measurements of the rotation velocity. However, for the gap with the highest dust depletion, the temperature gradient can be dominant and needs to be considered to derive accurate gas density profiles. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Self-consistent gas and dust thermo-chemical modelling in combination with high-quality observations of multiple molecules are necessary to accurately derive gas gap depths and shapes. This is crucial to determine the origin of gaps and rings in planet-forming disks and to improve the mass estimates of forming planets if they are the cause of the gap.},

Density waves launched by the planet are assumed to be damped as a result of their nonlinear evolution leading to shock formation and its subsequent dissipation. As a consequence, wave angular momentum is transferred to the disk, leading to evolution of its surface density. Planetary migration is an important ingredient of the theory; effects of the planet-induced surface density perturbations on the migration speed are considered. A gap is assumed to form when a stationary solution for the surface density profile is no longer possible in the frame of reference migrating with the planet. An analytical limit on the planetary mass necessary to open a gap in an inviscid disk is derived. The critical mass turns out to be smaller than the mass M1 for which the planetary Hill radius equals the disk scale height by a factor of at least Q5/7 (Q is the Toomre stability parameter), depending on the strength of the migration feedback. In viscous disks the critical planetary mass could vary from \textasciitilde 0.2M1 to M1, depending on the disk viscosity. This implies that a gap could be formed by a planet with mass of 2-15 M{$\oplus$}, depending on the disk aspect ratio, viscosity, and the planet's location in the nebula.},

However, we do find a strong linear correlation between {$\alpha$} and the central mass accretion rate \textbackslash dot\{M\}. This correlation is unlikely to result from the direct physical effect of \textbackslash dot\{M\} on internal stress on global scales. Instead, we suggest that it is caused by the decoupling of stellar \textbackslash dot\{M\} from the global disk characteristics in one of the following ways: (1) The behavior (and range) of {$\alpha$} is controlled by a yet-unidentified parameter (e.g., ionization fraction, magnetic field strength, or geometry), ultimately driving the variation of \textbackslash dot\{M\}. (2) The central \textbackslash dot\{M\} is decoupled from the global accretion rate as a result of an instability, or mass accumulation (or loss in a wind or planetary accretion) in the inner disk. (3) Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is that angular momentum in protoplanetary disks is transported nonviscously, e.g., via magnetohydrodynamic winds or spiral density waves.},

  abstract = {We study the mutual evolution of the orbital properties of high-mass ratio, circular, co-planar binaries and their surrounding discs, using 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the evolution of binary and disc eccentricity, cavity structure, and the formation of orbiting azimuthal overdense features in the disc. Even with circular initial conditions, all discs with mass ratios q {$>$} 0.05 develop eccentricity. We find that disc eccentricity grows abruptly after a relatively long time-scale ({$\sim$}400-700 binary orbits), and is associated with a very small increase in the binary eccentricity. When disc eccentricity grows, the cavity semimajor axis reaches values \$a\_\{\textbackslash rm cav\}\textbackslash approx 3.5\textbackslash, a\_\{\textbackslash rm bin\}\$ . We also find that the disc eccentricity correlates linearly with the cavity size. Viscosity and orbit crossing appear to be responsible for halting the disc eccentricity growth - eccentricity at the cavity edge in the range ecav {$\sim$} 0.05-0.35. Our analysis shows that the current theoretical framework cannot fully explain the origin of these evolutionary features when the binary is almost circular (ebin {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.01); we speculate about alternative explanations. As previously observed, we find that the disc develops an azimuthal overdense feature in Keplerian motion at the edge of the cavity. A low-contrast overdensity still co-moves with the flow after 2000 binary orbits; such an overdensity can in principle cause significant dust trapping, with important consequences for protoplanetary disc observations.},

We detect H band emission at the location of the protoplanet HD 100546 b, but show that the choice of data processing parameters strongly affects the morphology of this source. It appears point-like in some aggressive reductions, but rejoins an extended disk structure in the majority of the others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emission appears stationary on a timescale of 4.6 years, inconsistent at the 2{$\sigma$} level with a Keplerian clockwise orbit at 59 au in the disk plane. The H band spectrum of the emission is inconsistent with any type of low effective temperature object or accreting protoplanetary disk. It strongly suggests a scattered-light origin, as this is consistent with the spectrum of the star and the spectra extracted at other locations in the disk. A non-detection at the 5{$\sigma$} level of HD 100546 b in differential H{$\alpha$} imaging places an upper limit, assuming the protoplanet lies in a gap free of extinction, on the accretion luminosity of 1.7 \texttimes{} 10-4 L {$\odot$} and M\textbackslash dot\{M\}{$<$} 6.3\texttimes{} \{10\}-7 \{M\}\{Jup\}2 \{\{yr\}\}-1 for 1 R Jup. These limits are comparable to the accretion luminosity and accretion rate of T-Tauri stars or LkCa 15 b. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that the H band source at the location of HD 100546 b is not emitted by a planetary photosphere or an accreting circumplanetary disk but is a disk feature enhanced by the point-spread function subtraction process. This non-detection is consistent with the non-detection in the K band reported in an earlier study but does not exclude the possibility that HD 100546 b is deeply embedded.},

In this context we observed the Herbig A5 star MWC 758 with the L\textsuperscript{'}-band vector vortex coronagraph installed in the near-infrared camera and spectrograph NIRC2 at the Keck II telescope, with the aim of unveiling the nature of the spiral structure by constraining the presence of planetary companions in the system. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: Our high-contrast imaging observations show a bright ({$\Delta$}L\textsuperscript{'} = 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.3 mag) point-like emission south of MWC 758 at a deprojected separation of 20 au (r = 0.''111 {$\pm$} 0.''004) from the central star.

Spiral arm structure within the circum-multiple disk is well resolved in dust continuum toward IRS3B, and we detect the known wide ({$\sim$}2300 au) companion, IRS3A, also resolving possible spiral substructure. Using dense gas tracers, C17O (J = 3 \$\textbackslash to \$ 2), H13CO+ (J = 4 \$\textbackslash to \$ 3), and H13CN (J = 4 \$\textbackslash to \$ 3), we resolve the Keplerian rotation for both the circum-triple disk in IRS3B and the disk around IRS3A. Furthermore, we use the molecular line kinematic data and radiative transfer modeling of the molecular line emission to confirm that the disks are in Keplerian rotation with fitted masses of \$\{1.19\}\_\{-0.07\}\^\{+0.13\}\$ M{$\odot$} for IRS3B-ab and \$\{1.51\}\_\{-0.07\}\^\{+0.06\}\$ M{$\odot$} for IRS3A and place an upper limit on the central protostar mass for the tertiary IRS3B-c of 0.2 M{$\odot$}.

This coincides with the location of the spiral arms and the tertiary companion IRS3B-c, supporting the hypothesis that IRS3B-c was formed in situ via fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk.},

However, most of the high-resolution observations have focused only on the continuum emission. In this paper, we present high-resolution ALMA band 7 (0.89 mm) observations of the disc around the star CI Tau in the 12CO \& 13CO J = 3-2 and CS J = 7-6 emission lines. Our recent work demonstrated that the disc around CI Tau contains three gaps and rings in continuum emission, and we look for their counterparts in the gas emission. While we find no counterpart of the third gap and ring in 13CO, the disc has a gap in emission at the location of the second continuum ring (rather than gap). We demonstrate that this is mostly an artefact of the continuum subtraction, although a residual gap still remains after accounting for this effect. Through radiative transfer modelling, we propose this is due to the inner disc shadowing the outer parts of the disc and making them colder. This raises a note of caution in mapping high-resolution gas emission lines observations to the gas surface density - while possible, this needs to be done carefully. In contrast to 13CO, CS emission shows instead a ring morphology, most likely due to chemical effects. Finally, we note that 12CO is heavily absorbed by the foreground preventing any morphological study using this line.},

While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect H{$\alpha$} emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet.},

We investigate the spatial distribution of various charged particles and the unstable regions for a variety of models for protoplanetary disks, taking into account the recombination of ions and electrons at grain surfaces, which is an important process in most parts of the disks. We find that for all the models there is an inner region that is magnetorotationally stable due to ohmic dissipation. This must make the accretion onto the central star nonsteady. For the model of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the critical radius, inside of which the disk is stable, is about 20 AU, and the mass accretion rate just outside the critical radius is 10-7-10-6 Msolar yr-1. The stable region is smaller in a disk of lower column density. Dust grains in protoplanetary disks may grow by mutual sticking and may sediment toward the midplane of the disks. We find that the stable region shrinks as the grain size increases or the sedimentation proceeds. Therefore, in the late evolutionary stages, protoplanetary disks can be magnetorotationally unstable even in the inner regions.},

With much of the protoplanetary disk too cold for the main gas constituent, H2, to emit, alternative tracers such as dust, CO, or the H2 isotopologue HD are used. However, relying on disk mass measurements from any single tracer requires assumptions about the tracer's abundance relative to H2 and the disk temperature structure. Using new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program as well as archival ALMA observations, we construct a disk physical/chemical model of the protoplanetary disk GM Aur. Our model is in good agreement with the spatially resolved CO isotopologue emission from 11 rotational transitions with spatial resolution ranging from 0"15 to 0"46 (24-73 au at 159 pc) and the spatially unresolved HD J = 1-0 detection from Herschel. Our best-fit model favors a cold protoplanetary disk with a total gas mass of approximately 0.2 M{$\odot$}, a factor of 10 reduction in CO gas inside roughly 100 au and a factor of 100 reduction outside of 100 au. Despite its large mass, the disk appears to be on the whole gravitationally stable based on the derived Toomre Q parameter. However, the region between 70 and 100 au, corresponding to one of the millimeter dust rings, is close to being unstable based on the calculated Toomre Q of {$<$}1.7.

The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M \&gt; 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbed by the low temperature outer regions. saturated by broad recombination and resonance emission lines. Variability, connected with the character of the motion of the black hole, with gas flows in a binary system and with eclipses, is possible. Under certain conditions, the hard radiation can evaporate the gas. This can counteract the matter inflow into the disk and lead to autoregulation of the accretion.

Similarity solutions are determined for the collapse of singular isothermal spheres, minus solutions without critical points are obtained by imposing the condition that the fluid velocities are negligible at the 'initial instant', and an expansion-wave collapse solution is evaluated. The results are illustrated with a numerical example roughly corresponding to conditions appropriate for Bok globules or the central regions of a nonmagnetic molecular cloud. Two possible applications of the solutions are discussed: analyzing the stability to gravitational fragmentation of collapsing pressure-free gas spheres and determining the amount of energy radiated away during protostar formation.},

  abstract = {Constraining dust properties of planet-forming disks via high-angular-resolution observations is fundamental to understanding how solids are trapped in substructures and how dust growth may be favored or accelerated therein. We use ALMA dust continuum observations of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) disks and explore a large parameter space to constrain the radial distribution of solid mass and maximum grain size in each disk, including or excluding dust scattering. In the nonscattering model, the dust surface density and maximum grain size profiles decrease from the inner disks to the outer disks, with local maxima at the bright ring locations, as expected from dust trapping models. The inferred maximum grain sizes from the inner to outer disks decrease from 1 cm to 1 mm. For IM Lup, HD 163296, and MWC 480 in the scattering model, two solutions are compatible with their observed inner disk emission: one solution corresponding to a maximum grain size of a few millimeters (similar to the nonscattering model), and the other corresponding to a size of a few hundred micrometers. Based on the estimated Toomre parameter, only IM Lup-which shows a prominent spiral morphology in millimeter dust-is found to be gravitationally unstable. The estimated maximum Stokes number in all the disks lies between 0.01 and 0.3, and the estimated turbulence parameters in the rings of AS 209 and HD 163296 are close to the threshold where dust growth is limited by turbulent fragmentation.

  abstract = {We investigate the strength of axisymmetric local pressure maxima (zonal flows) in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, where ambipolar diffusion reduces turbulent stresses driven by the magnetorotational instability. Using local numerical simulations we show that in the absence of net vertical magnetic fields, the strength of turbulence in the ambipolar dominated region of the disk is low and any zonal flows that are present are weak. For net fields strong enough to yield observed protostellar accretion rates, however, zonal flows with a density amplitude of 10\%-20\% are formed. These strengths are comparable to those seen in simulations of ideal MHD disk turbulence. We investigate whether these zonal flows are able to reverse the inward radial drift of solids, leading to prolonged and enhanced concentration as a prelude to planetesimal formation. For commonly assumed mean surface density profiles (surface density {$\Sigma$}vpropr -1/2 or steeper) we find that the predicted perturbations to the background disk profile do not correspond to local pressure maxima. This is a consequence of radial width of the simulated zonal flows, which is larger than was assumed in prior analytic models of particle trapping. These larger scale flows would only trap particles for higher amplitude fluctuations than observed. We conclude that zonal flows are likely to be present in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks and are potentially large enough to be observable, but are unlikely to lead to strong particle trapping.},

A detailed investigation of eight rings detected in five disks by the DSHARP survey came to the conclusion that all rings are just marginally optically thick with optical depths between 0.2 and 0.5 at a wavelength of 1.25 mm. This surprising result could either be coincidental or indicate that the optical depth in all of the rings is regulated by the same process. We investigated if ongoing planetesimal formation could explain the ``fine-tuned'' optical depths in the DSHARP rings by removing dust and transforming it into ``invisible'' planetesimals. We performed a one-dimensional simulation of dust evolution in the second dust ring of the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296, including radial transport of gas and dust, dust growth and fragmentation, and planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of sufficiently dense pebble concentrations. We show that planetesimal formation can naturally explain the observed optical depths if streaming instability regulates the midplane dust-to-gas ratio to unity. Furthermore, our simple monodisperse analytical model supports the hypothesis that planetesimal formation in dust rings should universally limit their optical depth to the observed range.},

It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a "task list" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

The amplitude of the dust spiral decreases with the Stokes number (St) and starts to fade out at a typical St \&gt; 0.1 as the dust becomes decoupled from the gas. The semi-analytical model provides an accurate and fast representation of the difference in the surface density of the spiral in dust and gas.

We implemented a radiative transfer module into the JUPITER code to account for realistic heating and cooling of the gas. We focus on the circumplanetary gas flow, determining its characteristics at very high resolution (80 per cent of Jupiter's diameter). In our nominal simulation where the temperature evolves freely by the radiative module and reaches 13000 K at the planet, a circumplanetary envelope was formed filling the entire Roche lobe. Because of our equation of state is simplified and probably overestimates the temperature, we also performed simulations with limited maximal temperatures in the planet region (1000, 1500, and 2000 K). In these fixed temperature cases circumplanetary discs (CPDs) were formed. This suggests that the capability to form a CPD is not simply linked to the mass of the planet and its ability to open a gap. Instead, the gas temperature at the planet's location, which depends on its accretion history, plays also fundamental role. The CPDs in the simulations are hot and cooling very slowly, they have very steep temperature and density profiles, and are strongly sub-Keplerian. Moreover, the CPDs are fed by a strong vertical influx, which shocks on the CPD surfaces creating a hot and luminous shock-front. In contrast, the pressure supported circumplanetary envelope is characterized by internal convection and almost stalled rotation.},

The morphologies of these reflection nebulae significantly differ from many other normal young stellar objects (Class I-II objects). These structures are attributed to gravitationally unstable disks, trails of clump ejections, dust blown by a wind or a jet, and a stellar companion. We can consistently explain our results with the scenario that their accretion outbursts (FUor outbursts) are triggered by gravitationally fragmenting disks, and with the hypothesis that many low-mass young stellar objects experience such outbursts.

  abstract = {Gravitational interaction between a planet and a three-dimensional isothermal gaseous disk is studied. In the present paper we mainly examine the torque on a planet and the resultant radial migration of the planet. A planet excites density waves at Lindblad and corotation resonances and experiences a negative torque by the density waves, which causes a rapid inward migration of the planet during its formation in a protoplanetary disk. We formulate the linear wave excitation in three-dimensional isothermal disks and calculate the torques of Lindblad resonances and corotation resonances. For corotation resonances, a general torque formula is newly derived, which is also applicable to two-dimensional disks. The new formula succeeds in reproducing numerical results on the corotation torques, which do not agree with the previously well-known formula. The net torque of the inner and the outer Lindblad resonances (i.e., the differential Lindblad torque) is caused by asymmetry such as the radial pressure gradient and the scale height variation. In three-dimensional disks, the differential Lindblad torques are generally smaller than those in two-dimensional disks. Especially, the effect of a pressure gradient becomes weak. The scale height variation, which is a purely three-dimensional effect, makes the differential Lindblad torque decrease. As a result, the migration time of a planet is obtained as of the order of 106 yr for an Earth-size planet at 5 AU for a typical disk model, which is longer than the result of two-dimensional calculation by the factor of 2 or 3. The reflected waves from disk edges, which are neglected in the torque calculation, can further weaken the disk-planet interaction.},

Based on detailed analyses of gas accretion flow, we find that most of gas accretion onto circumplanetary disks occurs nearly vertically toward the disk surface from high altitude, which generates a shock surface at several scale heights of the circumplanetary disk. The gas that has passed through the shock surface moves inward because its specific angular momentum is smaller than that of the local Keplerian rotation, while gas near the midplane in the protoplanetary disk cannot accrete to the circumplanetary disk. Gas near the midplane within the planet's Hill sphere spirals outward and escapes from the Hill sphere through the two Lagrangian points L1 and L2. We also analyze fluxes of accreting mass and angular momentum in detail and find that the distributions of the fluxes onto the disk surface are well described by power-law functions and that a large fraction of gas accretion occurs at the outer region of the disk, i.e., at about 0.1 times the Hill radius. The nature of power-law functions indicates that, other than the outer edge, there is no specific radius where gas accretion is concentrated. These source functions of mass and angular momentum in the circumplanetary disk would provide us with useful constraints on the structure and evolution of the circumplanetary disk, which is important for satellite formation.},

Using archival Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of HD 163296, we demonstrate a new technique to measure the rotation curves of CO isotopologue emission to sub-percent precision relative to the Keplerian rotation. These rotation curves betray substantial deviations caused by local perturbations in the radial pressure gradient, likely driven by gaps carved in the gas surface density by Jupiter-mass planets. Comparison with hydrodynamic simulations shows excellent agreement with the gas rotation profile when the disk surface density is perturbed by two Jupiter-mass planets at 83 and 137 au. As the rotation of the gas is dependent upon the pressure of the total gas component, this method provides a unique probe of the gas surface density profile without incurring significant uncertainties due to gas-to-dust ratios or local chemical abundances that plague other methods. Future analyses combining both methods promise to provide the most accurate and robust measures of embedded planetary mass. Furthermore, this method provides a unique opportunity to explore wide-separation planets beyond the mm continuum edge and to trace the gas pressure profile essential in modeling grain evolution in disks.},

  abstract = {We explore the dynamical structure of the protoplanetary disks surrounding HD 163296 and MWC 480 as part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) large program. Using the J = 2-1 transitions of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O imaged at spatial resolutions of \textasciitilde 0"15 and with a channel spacing of 200 m s-1, we find perturbations from Keplerian rotation in the projected velocity fields of both disks ({$\lessequivlnt$}5\% of the local Keplerian velocity), suggestive of large-scale (tens of astronomical units in size), coherent flows. By accounting for the azimuthal dependence on the projection of the velocity field, the velocity fields were decomposed into azimuthally averaged orthogonal components, v{$\varphi$}, vr, and vz. Using the optically thick 12CO emission as a probe of the gas temperature, local variations of {$\asymp$}3 K ({$\asymp$}5\% relative changes) were observed and found to be associated with the kinematic substructures. The MWC 480 disk hosts a suite of tightly wound spiral arms. The spirals arms, in conjunction with the highly localized perturbations in the gas velocity structure (kinematic planetary signatures), indicate a giant planet, \textasciitilde 1 MJup, at a radius of {$\asymp$}245 au. In the disk of HD 163296, the kinematic substructures were consistent with previous studies of Pinte et al. and Teague et al. advocating for multiple \textasciitilde 1 MJup planets embedded in the disk. These results demonstrate that molecular line observations that characterize the dynamical structure of disks can be used to search for the signatures of embedded planets. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.},

  abstract = {We present ALMA observations of CO J = 2 - 1 and CS J = 5 - 4 emission from the disk around TW Hydrae. Both molecules trace a predominantly Keplerian velocity structure, although a slowing of the rotation velocity is detected at the outer edge of the disk beyond {$\asymp$}140 au in CO emission. This was attributed to the enhanced pressure support from the gas density taper near the outer edge of the disk. Subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric background velocity structure reveals localized deviations in the gas kinematics traced by each of the molecules. Both CO and CS exhibit a "Doppler flip" feature, centered nearly along the minor axis of the disk (PA \textasciitilde{} 60\textdegree ) at a radius of 1.{${''}$}35, coinciding with the large gap observed in scattered light and mm continuum. In addition, the CO emission, both through changes in intensity and its kinematics, traces a tightly wound spiral, previously seen with higher-frequency CO J = 3 - 2 observations. Through comparison with linear models of the spiral wakes generated by embedded planets, we interpret these features in the context of interactions with a Saturn-mass planet within the gap at a position angle of PA = 60\textdegree, consistent with the theoretical predictions of Mentiplay et al. The lack of a corresponding spiral in the CS emission is attributed to the strong vertical dependence on the buoyancy spirals, which are believed to only grow in the atmospheric of the disk, rather than those traced by CS emission.},

The hydrodynamic equations, including self-gravity, can be reduced to a set of linear ordinary differential equations, which is solved by the method of matched asymptotic expansions. These calculations provide a self-consistent description of the dynamical collapse of rotating molecular cloud cores and a framework for the study of the formation of stars and nebular disks.},

Although observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter array (ALMA) have dramatically increased our understanding of these discs, total protoplanetary disc mass remains difficult to measure. If a disc is sufficiently massive ({$\greaterequivlnt$}10 per cent of the host star mass), it can excite gravitational instability (GI). Recently, it has been revealed that GI leaves kinematic imprints of its presence known as the 'GI Wiggle'. In this work, we use numerical simulations to determine an approximately linear relationship between the amplitude of the wiggle and the host disc-to-star mass ratio, and show that measurements of the amplitude are possible with the spatial and spectral capabilities of ALMA. These measurements can therefore be used to constrain disc-to-star mass ratio.},

  abstract = {In the core-accretion scenario for the formation of planetary rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although dust grains are thought to grow up to micrometer-sized particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds, the growth to pebbles and kilometer-sized bodies must occur at the high densities within protoplanetary disks. This critical step is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in extrasolar systems before the appearance of large planetary-sized bodies. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures of these processes are summarized. We briefly discuss grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars, as these likely provide the initial conditions for the dust in protoplanetary disks. We then review the observational constraints on grain growth in disks from millimeter surveys, as well as the very recent evidence for radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We also include a brief discussion on the small end of the grain size distribution and dust settling as derived from optical, near-, and mid-infrared observations. Results are discussed in the context of global dust-evolution models; in particular, we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of maximum grain sizes as the result of growth barriers. We also highlight the limits of the current models of dust evolution in disks, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains to overcome the migration/fragmentation barrier.},

  abstract = {If the angular momentum of the molecular cloud core were conserved during the star formation process, a newborn star would rotate much faster than its fission speed. This constitutes the angular momentum problem of newborn stars. In this Letter, the angular momentum transfer in the contraction of a rotating magnetized cloud is studied with axisymmetric MHD simulations. Because of the large dynamic range covered by the nested-grid method, the structure of the cloud in the range from 10 AU to 0.1 pc is explored. First, the cloud experiences a runaway collapse, and a disk forms perpendicularly to the magnetic field, in which the central density increases greatly in a finite timescale. In this phase, the specific angular momentum j of the disk decreases to about one-third of the initial cloud. After the central density of the disk exceeds \textasciitilde 1010 cm-3, the infall on to the central object develops. In this accretion stage, the rotation motion and thus the toroidal magnetic field drive the outflow. The angular momentum of the central object is transferred efficiently by the outflow as well as by the effect of the magnetic stress. In 7000 yr from the core formation, the specific angular momentum of the central 0.17 Msolar decreases a factor of 10-4 from the initial value (i.e., from 1020 to 1016 cm2 s-1).},

  abstract = {This paper considers the question of the large-scale gravitational stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large. Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From that, and the observed j\# and K, together with their uncertainties, this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.},

The observed visibility data were modeled with a simple prescription for the radial surface brightness profile. The results were used to extract intuitive, empirical estimates of the emission ``size'' for each disk, \{R\}\{eff\}, defined as the radius that encircles a fixed fraction of the total continuum luminosity, \{L\}\{mm\}. We find a significant correlation between the sizes and luminosities, such that \{R\}\{eff\}\textbackslash propto \{L\}\{mm\}0.5, providing a confirmation and quantitative characterization of a putative trend that was noted previously. This correlation suggests that these disks have roughly the same average surface brightness interior to their given effective radius, {$\sim$}0.2 Jy arcsec-2 (or 8 K in brightness temperature). The same trend remains, but the 0.2 dex of dispersion perpendicular to this relation essentially disappears, when we account for the irradiation environment of each disk with a crude approximation of the dust temperatures based on the stellar host luminosities. We consider two (not mutually exclusive) explanations for the origin of this size-luminosity relationship. Simple models of the growth and migration of disk solids can account for the observed trend for a reasonable range of initial conditions, but only on timescales that are much shorter than the nominal ages present in the sample. An alternative scenario invokes optically thick emission concentrated on unresolved scales, with filling factors of a few tens of percent, which is perhaps a manifestation of localized particle traps.},

For each, in turn, we outline the major achievements of the past few years and the outstanding questions. We underscore the requirements for operation, especially ionization for the magnetic processes and heating and cooling for the others. We describe the distribution and strength of the resulting flows and compare them with the long-used phenomenological a-picture, highlighting issues where the fuller physical picture yields substantially different answers. We also discuss the links between magnetized turbulence and magnetically launched outflows, and between magnetized turbulence and hydrodynamical vortices.

For a subsample of optically thin sources, we find a median spectral index of 2.5 from which we derive the dust opacity index {$\beta$} = 0.5, suggesting significant dust growth. Comparison with ALMA surveys of Orion shows that the Class I dust disk mass distribution between the two regions is similar, but that the Class 0 disks are more massive in Perseus than those in Orion. Using the DIANA opacity model including large grains, with a dust opacity value of {$\kappa$}\textsubscript{9 mm} = 0.28 cm\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1}, the median dust masses of the embedded disks in Perseus are 158 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} for Class 0 and 52 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} for Class I from the VLA fluxes. The lower limits on the median masses from ALMA fluxes are 47 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and 12 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} for Class 0 and Class I, respectively, obtained using the maximum dust opacity value {$\kappa$}\textsubscript{1.3 mm} = 2.3 cm\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1}. The dust masses of young Class 0 and I disks are larger by at least a factor of ten and three, respectively, compared with dust masses inferred for Class II disks in Lupus and other regions. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The dust masses of Class 0 and I disks in Perseus derived from the VLA data are high enough to produce the observed exoplanet systems with efficiencies acceptable by planet formation models: the solid content in observed giant exoplanets can be explained if planet formation starts in Class 0 phase with an efficiency of \textasciitilde 15\%. A higher efficiency of \textasciitilde 30\% is necessary if the planet formation is set to start in Class I disks.},

Cold gas may still be present inside these cavities, but quantying this gas is challenging. The gas content is important for constraining the origin of the dust cavity. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of \textsuperscript{12}CO 6-5 and 690 GHz (Band 9) continuum of five well-studied transitional disks. In addition, we analyze previously published Band 7 observations of a disk in the \textsuperscript{12}CO 3-2 line and 345 GHz continuum. The observations are used to set constraints on the gas and dust surface density profiles, in particular, the drop {$\delta$}\textsubscript{gas} of the gas density inside the dust cavity. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The physical-chemical modeling code DALI was used to simultaneously analyze the gas and dust images. We modeled SR21, HD 135344B, LkCa15, SR24S, and RX J1615-3255 (Band 9) and J1604-2130 (Band 7). The spectral energy distribution and continuum visibility curve constrain the dust surface density. Then we used the same model to calculate the \textsuperscript{12}CO emission, which we compared with the observations through spectra and intensity cuts. The amount of gas inside the cavity was quantified by varying the {$\delta$}\textsubscript{gas} parameter. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Model fits to the dust and gas indicate that gas is still present inside the dust cavity for all disks, but at a reduced level. The gas surface density drops inside the cavity by at least a factor 10, while the dust density drops by at least a factor 1000. Disk masses are comparable with previous estimates from the literature, cavity radii are found to be smaller than in the data obtained with the 345 GHz SubMillimeter Array. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The derived gas surface density profiles suggest that the cavity was cleared by one or more companions in all cases, which trapped the millimeter-sized dust at the edge of the cavity. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendix is available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525658/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

Models of planet-disk interaction predict that young planets clear a gap in the gas while trapping dust at larger radii. Other physical mechanisms might also be responsible for cavities. Previous observations have revealed that gas is still present inside these cavities, but the spatial distribution of this gas remains uncertain. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We present high spatial resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of \textsuperscript{13}CO and C\textsuperscript{18}O 3-2 or 6-5 lines of four well-studied transitional disks around pre-main-sequence stars with large dust cavities. The line and continuum observations are used to set constraints on the the gas surface density, specifically on the cavity size and density drop inside the cavity. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The physical-chemical model DALI was used to analyze the gas images of SR21, HD 135344B (also known as SAO 206462), DoAr44, and IRS 48. The main parameters of interest are the size, depth and shape of the gas cavity in each of the disks. CO isotope-selective photodissociation is included to properly constrain the surface density in the outer disk from C\textsuperscript{18}O emission. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The gas cavities are up to three times smaller than those of the dust in all four disks. Model fits indicate that the surface density inside the gas cavities decreases by a factor of 100 to 10 000 compared with the surface density profile derived from the outer disk. The data can be fit by either introducing one or two drops in the gas surface density or a surface density profile that increases with radius inside the cavity. A comparison with an analytical model of gap depths by planet-disk interaction shows that the disk viscosities are most likely low, between between 10\textsuperscript{-3} and 10\textsuperscript{-4} , for reasonable estimates of planet masses of up to 10 Jupiter masses. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The resolved measurements of the gas and dust in transition disk cavities support the predictions of models that describe how planet-disk interactions sculpt gas disk structures and influence the evolution of dust grains. These observed structures strongly suggest the presence of giant planetary companions in transition disk cavities, although at smaller orbital radii than is typically indicated from the dust cavity radii alone.},

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 (335 GHz or 0.89 mm) continuum observations of the transition disk HD 135344B at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.{${''}$}16, using superuniform weighting. The data show that the asymmetric millimeter-dust ring seen in previous work actually consists of an inner ring and an outer asymmetric structure. The outer feature is cospatial with the end of one of the spiral arms seen in scattered light, but the feature itself is not consistent with a spiral arm due to its coradiance. We propose a new possible scenario to explain the observed structures at both wavelengths. Hydrodynamical simulations show that a massive planet can generate a primary vortex (which dissipates at longer timescales, becoming an axisymmetric ring) and trigger the formation of a second generation vortex further out. Within this scenario, the two spiral arms observed at scattered light originate from a planet at {$\sim$}30 au and from the secondary vortex at {$\sim$}75 au rather than a planet further out as previously reported.},

Planet-forming disks are fundamental objects that are thought to be inherited from large scale rotation through the conservation of angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar dense core. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We investigate the possibility for a protostellar disk to be formed from a motionless dense core that contains nonaxisymmetric density fluctuations. The rotation is thus generated locally by the asymmetry of the collapse. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We study the evolution of the angular momentum in a nonaxisymmetric collapse of a dense core from an analytical point of view. To test the theory, we performed three-dimensional simulations of a collapsing prestellar dense core using adaptative mesh refinement. We started from a nonaxisymmetrical situation, considering a dense core with random density perturbations that follow a turbulence spectrum. We analyzed the emerging disk by comparing the angular momentum it contains with the one expected from our analytic development. We studied the velocity gradients at different scales in the simulation as is done with observations. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We show that the angular momentum in the frame of a stellar object, which is not located at the center of mass of the core, is not conserved due to inertial forces. Our simulations of such nonaxisymmetrical collapse quickly produce accretion disks at the small scales in the core. The analysis of the kinematics at different scales in the simulated core reveals projected velocity gradients of amplitudes similar to the ones observed in protostellar cores and for which directions vary, sometimes even reversing when small and large scales are compared. These complex kinematics patterns appear in recent observations and could be a discriminating feature with models where rotation is inherited from large scales. Our results from simulations without initial rotation are more consistent with these recent observations than when solid-body rotation is initially imprinted. Lastly, we show that the disks that formed in this scenario of nonaxisymmetrical gravitational collapse grow to reach sizes larger than those that are observed, and then fragment. We show that including a magnetic field in these simulations reduces the size of the outcoming disks and it prevents them from fragmenting, as is shown by previous studies. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: We show that in a nonaxisymmetrical collapse, the formation of a disk can be induced by small perturbations of the initial density field in the core, even in the absence of global large-scale rotation of the core. In this scenario, large disks are generic features that are natural consequences of the hydrodynamical fluid interactions and self-gravity. Since recent observations have shown that most disks are significantly smaller and have a size of a few tens of astronomical units, our study suggests that magnetic braking is the most likely explanation. The kinematics of our model are consistent with typically observed values of velocity gradients and specific angular momentum in protostellar cores. These results open a new avenue in which our understanding of the early phases of disk formation can be explored since they suggest that a fraction of the protostellar disks could be the product of nonaxisymmetrical collapse, rather than directly resulting from the conservation of preexisting large scale angular momentum in rotating cores.},

A possible explanation for the origin of such rings is the tidal interaction with an unseen planetary companion. The protoplanetary disc around DS Tau shows a wide gap in the ALMA observation at 1.3 mm. We construct a hydrodynamical model for the dust continuum observed by ALMA assuming the observed gap is carved by a planet between one and five Jupiter masses. We fit the shape of the radial intensity profile along the disc major axis varying the planet mass, the dust disc mass, and the evolution time of the system. The best-fitting model is obtained for a planet with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}=3.5\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{ M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ and a disc with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm dust\}= 9.6\textbackslash,\textbackslash times \textbackslash,10\^\{-5\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{ M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ . Starting from this result, we also compute the expected signature of the planet in the gas kinematics, as traced by CO emission.

  abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a high spatial resolution multiwavelength survey of 44 young binary star systems in Taurus-Auriga with separations of 10-1000 AU. These observations, which were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, quadruple the number of close (less than 100 AU) binary stars with spatially resolved measurements from 0.3 to 2.2 {$\mu$}m and are the first 3.6 {$\mu$}m measurements for the majority of the companion stars in the sample. Masses and ages are estimated for the components observed at optical wavelengths. The relative ages of binary star components are more similar than the relative ages of randomly paired single stars within the same star-forming region. This is the first statistically significant evidence for coeval formation. Only one of the companion masses is substellar, from which we conclude that the apparent overabundance of T Tauri star companions relative to main-sequence star companions is not due to a wealth of substellar secondaries that would have been missed in main-sequence surveys. The circumstellar environments of binary star systems are studied in this work through three diagnostics: the infrared color K-L, the ultraviolet excess {$\Delta$}U, and H{$\alpha$} emission. Several conclusions are drawn. First, the mass accretion rates for primary stars are similar to single stars, which suggests that companions as close as 10 AU have little effect on the mass accretion rate. Second, although most classical T Tauri star binaries retain both a circumprimary and a circumsecondary disk, there are several systems with only a circumprimary disk. Systems with only a circumsecondary disk are rare. This suggests that circumprimary disks survive longer than circumsecondary disks. Third, primary stars accrete at a higher rate, on average, than secondary stars. This is most likely because of their larger stellar mass, since the mass accretion rates for both single and binary T Tauri stars exhibit a moderate mass dependence. Fourth, approximately 10\% of T Tauri binary star components have very red near-infrared colors (K-L{$>$}1.4) and unusually high mass accretion rates. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to binary systems, however, since a comparable fraction of single T Tauri stars exhibit the same properties. These high accretion rate stars are probably not at an earlier stage of evolution, as has been proposed. Their semblance of younger protostars at optical and infrared wavelengths is most likely because of their similar high levels of accretion, which are above the norm for T Tauri stars, and not because of similar ages. The stellar and circumstellar properties are also used to trace indirectly the evolution of circumbinary material. In contrast to single T Tauri stars, which have disk dissipation timescales comparable to their ages, the disk dissipation timescales for binary T Tauri stars are \textasciitilde 10 times less than their ages. Replenishment of the inner circumstellar disks may be necessary to explain the continuing disk accretion in these systems. The longer disk lifetimes of circumprimary disks, despite their higher depletion rates, suggest that circumprimary disks are being preferentially replenished, possibly from a circumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum relative to the binary. Further support for circumbinary reservoirs comes from the observed correlated presence of circumprimary and circumsecondary disks for binaries with separations of less than \textasciitilde 200 AU. The presence of disks appears uncorrelated for wider binaries. Additionally, binaries with separations of less than \textasciitilde 100 AU exhibit a higher fraction of high mass ratio (ms/mp) pairs than wider binaries. These separation-dependent properties can be explained if the components are being replenished from a common circumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum. The components of the closest pairs are expected to be more equally replenished than the widest pairs, which consequently sustains both disks and drives their mass ratios toward unity. Overall, the results of this study corroborate previous work that suggests that fragmentation is the dominant binary star formation mechanism in Taurus-Auriga disk instabilities and capture seem unlikely.},

  abstract = {Flattened, rotating disks of cool dust and gas extending for tens to hundreds of astronomical units are found around almost all low-mass stars shortly after their birth. These disks generally persist for several million years, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at IR through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages; measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System. This review addresses observations of the outer parts, beyond 1 AU, of protoplanetary disks with a focus on recent IR and (sub)millimeter results and an eye to the promise of new facilities in the immediate future.},

  abstract = {Context. In recent years high-angular-resolution observations have revealed that circumstellar discs appear in a variety of shapes with diverse substructures being ubiquitous. This has given rise to the question of whether these substructures are triggered by planet-disc interactions. Besides direct imaging, one of the most promising methods to distinguish between different disc-shaping mechanisms is to study the kinematics of the gas disc. In particular, the deviations of the rotation profile from Keplerian velocity can be used to probe perturbations in the gas pressure profile that may be caused by embedded (proto-) planets. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: In this paper we aim to analyse the gas brightness temperature and kinematics of the transitional disc around the intermediate-mass star CQ Tau in order to resolve and characterise substructure in the gas caused by possible perturbers. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: For our analysis we used spatially resolved ALMA observations of the three CO isotopologues \textsuperscript{12}CO, \textsuperscript{13}CO, and C\textsuperscript{18}O (J = 2-1) from the disc around CQ Tau. We further extracted robust line centroids for each channel map and fitted a number of Keplerian disc models to the velocity field. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The gas kinematics of the CQ Tau disc present non-Keplerian features, showing bent and twisted iso-velocity curves in \textsuperscript{12}CO and \textsuperscript{13}CO. Significant spiral structures are detected between \textasciitilde 10 and 180 au in both the brightness temperature and the rotation velocity of \textsuperscript{12}CO after subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric model, which may be tracing planet-disc interactions with an embedded planet or low-mass companion. We identify three spirals, two in the brightness temperature and one in the velocity residuals, spanning a large azimuth and radial extent. The brightness temperature spirals are morphologically connected to spirals observed in near-infrared scattered light in the same disc, indicating a common origin. Together with the observed large dust and gas cavity, these spiral structures support the hypothesis of a massive embedded companion in the CQ Tau disc. {$<$}P /{$>$}The reduced datacubes are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/648/A19"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/648/A19{$<$}/A{$>$}},

We model 50 M{$\odot$} turbulent clouds initially threaded by a uniform magnetic field with strengths of 3, 5 10, and 20 times the critical mass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and at each strength, we model both an ideal and non-ideal (including Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) MHD cloud. Turbulence and magnetic fields shape the large-scale structure of the cloud, and similar structures form regardless of whether ideal or non-ideal MHD is employed. At high densities (106 {$\lessequivlnt$} nH {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011 cm-3), all models have a similar magnetic field strength versus density relation, suggesting that the field strength in dense cores is independent of the large-scale environment. Albeit with limited statistics, we find no evidence for the dependence of the initial mass function on the initial magnetic field strength, however, the star formation rate decreases for models with increasing initial field strengths; the exception is the strongest field case where collapse occurs primarily along field lines. Protostellar discs with radii {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20 au form in all models, suggesting that disc formation is dependent on the gas turbulence rather than on magnetic field strength. We find no evidence for the magnetic braking catastrophe, and find that magnetic fields do not hinder the formation of protostellar discs.},

We performed fitting to the spectral energy distributions obtained at the six wavelengths with the graybody slab models to estimate the distributions of the dust surface density and spectral index of dust absorption coefficient {$\beta$}. We also estimated the distribution of the gas column density by fitting the C18O spectra and measured the disk rotation by fitting the Keplerian disk models to the C18O data. We found super- and sub-Keplerian rotation inside and outside the dust ring in the northwest in the HD 142527 disk, suggestive of the presence of a local pressure bump. In comparison with our estimated dust and gas distributions, the location of the pressure bump is coincident with the region showing a three times higher dust density and a three times lower gas-to-dust mass ratio than the mean values in the disk, suggesting dust trapping in the pressure bump. Nevertheless, there is no correlation between our derived {$\beta$} distribution and the location of the pressure bump. In addition, we found that the width of the dust ring is comparable to or larger than the width of the pressure bump, which could suggest that dust feedback is significant in the pressure bump.},

  abstract = {Many circumstellar discs appear to have misaligned central regions that give rise to shadows seen in scattered light observations. Small warps ({$<$}20{$\bigcirc$} misalignment) are probably more common but are also more difficult to detect than the large misalignments studied previously. We present the characteristics of CO emission that may be used to identify a small disc warp, found from synthetic 13CO maps of a model misaligned circumbinary disc. The spectra are not symmetrical, so fitting a Keplerian model is not appropriate and can hide a warp or lead to spurious features such as spirals appearing in the residuals. We quantify the observed warp structure by fitting sinusoids to concentric annuli of the disc. From this we can trace the radial variation of the peak velocity and of the azimuth of the peak velocity, i.e., the twist. At near face-on inclinations, these radial profiles reveal the warp structure. The twist remains detectable at moderate inclinations (iouter disc {$\lessequivlnt$} 35{$\bigcirc$}) in the absence of radial flows but the measured inclination must be accurate to {$\lessequivlnt$} 5{$\bigcirc$} to allow detection of the radial variation. The observed twist does not provide a direct measure of the warp structure because of its dependence on optical depth. The warp causes broad asymmetries in the channel maps that span several channels and that are distinct from localised features caused by embedded planets and gravitational instability. We suspect that kinematic evidence of warps may have been missed and we suggest a few examples where the data may be revisited.},

We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26 using three different methods, two using ZDI and one Gaussian-process regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than 6 \texttimes{} 10-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window, the orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with highest likelihood is 10.79 {$\pm$} 0.14 d followed by 8.99 {$\pm$} 0.09 d. Assuming the most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial plane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass Msin I of 1.66 {$\pm$} 0.31 MJup and orbits at 0.0968 {$\pm$} 0.0032 au from its host star. This new detection suggests that disc type II migration is efficient at generating newborn hJs, and that hJs may be more frequent around young T Tauri stars than around mature stars (or that the MaTYSSE sample is biased towards hJ-hosting stars).},

At 125 au, we identify a coherent flow from the disk surface to the midplane, traced by all three CO isotopologues, and interpret it as a meridional flow potentially driven by an embedded planet. We use changes in the rotation speed of the gas to characterize the physical structure across this region, finding that at 125 au the CO emission traces regions of increased gas pressure, despite being at a surface density minimum. Developing a simple analytical model, we demonstrate that the physical structure of the gap can have non-trivial responses to changes in the surface density, consistent both with previous thermo-chemical models and the conditions inferred observationally. Applying this technique to a range of sources will allow us to directly confront theoretical models of gap-opening in protoplanetary disks.},

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation, and settling.},

To explore the properties of planets that may be responsible for these substructures, we systematically carry out a grid of 2D hydrodynamical simulations, including both gas and dust components. We present the resulting gas structures, including the relationship between the planet mass, as well as (1) the gaseous gap depth/width and (2) the sub/super-Keplerian motion across the gap. We then compute dust continuum intensity maps at the frequency of the DSHARP observations. We provide the relationship between the planet mass, as well as (1) the depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity maps, (2) the gap edge ellipticity and asymmetry, and (3) the position of secondary gaps induced by the planet. With these relationships, we lay out the procedure to constrain the planet mass using gap properties, and study the potential planets in the DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement between observations and simulations for AS 209 and the detectability of the young solar system analog. Finally, under the assumption that the detected gaps are induced by young planets, we characterize the young planet population in the planet mass-semimajor axis diagram. We find that the occurrence rate for {$>$}5 M J planets beyond 5-10 au is consistent with direct imaging constraints. Disk substructures allow us to probe a wide-orbit planet population (Neptune to Jupiter mass planets beyond 10 au) that is not accessible to other planet searching techniques.},

Our analysis employs observations of the (J = 2-1) and (1-0) lines of 13CO and C18O and the (J = 1-0) line of C17O for five protoplanetary disks. We retrieve CO gas density distributions, using three independent methods: (1) a thermochemical modeling framework based on the CO data, the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the millimeter continuum emission; (2) an empirical temperature distribution based on optically thick CO lines; and (3) a direct fit to the C17O hyperfine lines. Results from these methods generally show excellent agreement. The CO gas column density profiles of the five disks show significant variations in the absolute value and the radial shape. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, all five disks have a global CO-to-H2 abundance 10-100 times lower than the interstellar medium ratio. The CO gas distributions between 150 and 400 au match well with models of viscous disks, supporting the long-standing theory. CO gas gaps appear to be correlated with continuum gap locations, but some deep continuum gaps do not have corresponding CO gaps. The relative depths of CO and dust gaps are generally consistent with predictions of planet-disk interactions, but some CO gaps are 5-10 times shallower than predictions based on dust gaps.

Although the formation of circumstellar disks can be a natural result of the conservation of angular momentum in the parent cloud, theoretical studies instead show disk formation to be difficult from dense molecular cores magnetized to a realistic level, owing to efficient magnetic braking that transports a large fraction of the angular momentum away from the circumstellar region. We review recent progress in the formation and early evolution of disks around young stellar objects of both low-mass and high-mass, with an emphasis on mechanisms that may bridge the gap between observation and theory, including non-ideal MHD effects and asymmetric perturbations in the collapsing core (e.g., magnetic field misalignment and turbulence). We also address the associated processes of outflow launching and the formation of multiple systems, and discuss possible implications in properties of protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We carry out local three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interaction in stratified disks with varied thermodynamic properties. We find that whenever the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency (N) in the disk is non-zero, the planet exerts a strong torque on the disk in the vicinity of the planet, with a reduction in the traditional "torque cutoff." In particular, this is true for adiabatic perturbations in disks with isothermal density structure, as should be typical for centrally irradiated protoplanetary disks. We identify this torque with buoyancy waves, which are excited (when N is non-zero) close to the planet, within one disk scale height from its orbit. These waves give rise to density perturbations with a characteristic 3D spatial pattern which is in close agreement with the linear dispersion relation. The torque due to these waves can amount to as much as several tens of percent of the total planetary torque, which is not expected based on analytical calculations limited to axisymmetric or low-m modes. Buoyancy waves should be ubiquitous around planets in the inner, dense regions of protoplanetary disks, where they might possibly affect planet migration.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging observations have revealed spiral structures in protoplanetary disks. Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot explain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high contrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks excited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the pitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be explained by the nonlinear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a tertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive planet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have larger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in the azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in the outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have significant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk atmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more prominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3D hydrodynamical models than images based on two-dimensional models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, indicating the need to model observations with full 3D hydrodynamics. Overall, companion-induced spiral arms not only pinpoint the companion's position but also provide three independent ways (pitch angle, separation between two arms, and contrast of arms) to constrain the companion's mass.},

  abstract = {We study dust transport in turbulent protoplanetary disks using three-dimensional global unstratified MHD simulations including Lagrangian dust particles. The turbulence is driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with either ideal or non-ideal MHD that includes ambipolar diffusion (AD). In ideal MHD simulations, the surface density evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion, and vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simple one-dimensoinal and/or analytical models. However, in AD dominated simulations which simulate protoplanetary disks beyond 10s of AU, the vertical scale height of dust is larger than previously predicted. To understand this anomaly in more detail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box simulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated disks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions and power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite different particle diffusion efficiency. For example, MRI turbulence with AD has a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causes significant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height. In ideal MHD the Schmidt numbers (Sc) for radial and vertical turbulent diffusion are S\{\{c\}r\}{$\sim$} 1 and S\{\{c\}z\}{$\greaterequivlnt$} 3, but in the AD dominated regime both Scr and Scz are {$\lessequivlnt$} 1. Particle concentration in pressure bumps induced by MRI turbulence has also been studied. Since non-ideal MHD effects dominate most regions in protoplanetary disks, our study suggests that modeling dust transport in turbulence driven by MRI with non-ideal MHD effects is important for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We carry out 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study planet-disc interactions for inclined high-mass planets, focusing on the disc's secular evolution induced by the planet. We find that, when the planet is massive enough and the induced gap is deep enough, the disc inside the planet's orbit breaks from the outer disc. The inner and outer discs precess around the system's total angular momentum vector independently at different precession rates, which causes significant disc misalignment. We derive the analytical formulae, which are also verified numerically, for: (1) the relationship between the planet mass and the depth/width of the induced gap, (2) the migration and inclination damping rates for massive inclined planets, and (3) the condition under which the inner and outer discs can break and undergo differential precession. Then, we carry out Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations for the simulated broken discs. Both disc shadowing in near-infrared images and gas kinematics probed by molecular lines [e.g. from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)] can reveal the misaligned inner disc. The relationship between the rotation rate of the disc shadow and the precession rate of the inner disc is also provided. Using our disc breaking condition, we conclude that the disc shadowing due to misaligned discs should be accompanied by deep gaseous gaps (e.g. in Pre/Transitional discs). This scenario naturally explains both the disc shadowing and deep gaps in several systems (e.g. HD 100453, DoAr 44, AA Tau, and HD 143006) and these systems should be the prime targets for searching young massive planets ({$>$}MJ) in discs.},

  abstract = {Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) surveys have suggested that the dust in Class II disks may not be enough to explain the averaged solid mass in exoplanets, under the assumption that the mm disk continuum emission is optically thin. This optically thin assumption seems to be supported by recent Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) observations where the measured optical depths are mostly less than one. However, we point out that dust scattering can considerably reduce the emission from an optically thick region. If that scattering is ignored, an optically thick disk with scattering can be misidentified as an optically thin disk. Dust scattering in more inclined disks can reduce the intensity even further, making the disk look even fainter. The measured optical depth of {$\sim$}0.6 in several DSHARP disks can be naturally explained by optically thick dust with an albedo of {$\sim$}0.9 at 1.25 mm. Using the DSHARP opacity, this albedo corresponds to a dust population with the maximum grain size (s max) of 0.1-1 mm. For optically thick scattering disks, the measured spectral index {$\alpha$} can be either larger or smaller than 2 depending on whether the dust albedo increases or decreases with wavelength. We describe how this optically thick scattering scenario could explain the observed scaling between submm continuum sizes and luminosities, and might help ease the tension between the dust size constraints from polarization and dust continuum measurements. We suggest that a significant amount of disk mass can be hidden from ALMA observations and longer wavelength observations (e.g., Very Large Array or Square Kilometre Array) are desired to probe the dust mass in disks.},

  abstract = {Spirals in protoplanetary discs have been used to locate the potential planet in discs. Since only the spiral shape from a circularly orbiting perturber is known, most previous works assume that the planet is in a circular orbit. We develop a simple semi-analytical method to calculate the shape of the spirals launched by an eccentric planet. We assume that the planet emits wavelets during its orbit, and the wave fronts of these propagating wavelets form the spirals. The resulting spiral shape from this simple method agrees with numerical simulations exceptionally well. The spirals excited by an eccentric planet can detach from the planet, bifurcate, or even cross each other, which are all reproduced by this simple method. The spiral's bifurcation point corresponds to the wavelet that is emitted when the planet's radial speed reaches the disc's sound speed. Multiple spirals can be excited by an eccentric planet (more than five spirals when e {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.2). The pitch angle and pattern speed are different between different spirals and can vary significantly across one spiral. The spiral wakes launched by high-mass eccentric planets steepen to spiral shocks and the crossing of spiral shocks leads to distorted or broken spirals. With the same mass, a more eccentric planet launches weaker spirals and induces a shallower gap over a long period of time. The observed unusually large/small pitch angles of some spirals, the irregular multiple spirals, and the different pattern speeds between different spirals may suggest the existence of eccentric perturbers in protoplanetary discs.},
