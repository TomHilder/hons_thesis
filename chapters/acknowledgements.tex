    {\Large \textbf{Acknowledgements}}

\noindent I would like to thank my supervisors, Daniel Price and Christophe Pinte, for their guidance, wisdom and support over the course of the year.
I feel privileged to have been part of a team that is dedicated to both high quality research and to having a laugh along the way.
Thank you also to my collaborators, and in particular to Josh Calcino whom I worked with closely for my first published work.
And of course I cannot forget my fellow students; while my honours year was certainly challenging, sharing it with so many great people helped make it all worthwhile.

I would also like to thank my partner Kayla for her constant support and seemingly limitless reserves of patience.
Finally, thank you to my parents for teaching me to be curious and that no challenge is insurmountable, I hope that I have made you proud.
