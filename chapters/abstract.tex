\noindent We present a semi-analytic framework for detecting and measuring planets through measurements of their spiral wakes in observations of protoplanetary disk kinematics.
Building on previous work, we provide improvements to the accuracy and speed of semi-analytic models for the planet-disk interaction, and present our Python package \textsc{wakeflow} that can readily generate these models in a few seconds.
This work is then used to constrain potential planets in observations of the circumstellar disks of HD~163296, HD~169142, and IM~Lupi by modelling the signatures of planet wakes present in molecular line emission.
Finally, we present our preliminary work on the development of a fitting procedure for planet mass, using \textsc{wakeflow} models.
