\section{Accretion Disk Physics}

\note{define differential rotation as per Binney and Tremaine}

Consider a test particle orbiting in a Newtonian point mass potential. Its angular velocity $\Omega$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \Omega = \Omega_{\rm K} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{G M_*}{r^3}}, \label{eq:point_pot}
\end{align}
where $M_*$ is the central mass, $r$ is the orbital radius, $G$ is Newton's constant and $\Omega_{\rm K}$ signifies Keplerian rotation. 
Thus the orbital speed is a decreasing function of radius $v_\phi = r \Omega_{\rm K} \propto r^{-1/2}$.
Additionally, the specific angular momentum $h$ of the particle is given by
\begin{align}
    h = r \Omega^2 = \sqrt{G M_* r}, \label{eq:ang_mom}
\end{align}
and so we see that $h$ is an increasing function of radius as $h \propto r^{1/2}$.
Together the above quantities constitute a key feature of accretion disks; shearing stresses between annuli of material orbiting at slightly different radii, as well as other instabilities, allow for angular momentum transport within the disk. 
This means inner material may lose its angular momentum to the outer disk and accrete onto the star. 
Alternatively, the whole disk may lose angular momentum to its environment, for example through magnetised outflows that induce a torque on the disk.

\subsection{Fluid equations} \label{sec:fluid_eqns}

The structure and evolution of accretion disks are governed by the viscous and compressible continuity and momentum equations given by \citep[eg.][]{landau1987}
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot (\rho \VF{v}) &= 0, \label{eq:fluid_cont} \\
    \partial_t \VF{v} + (\VF{v} \cdot \nabla) \VF{v} &= \frac{1}{\rho} \left( \nabla \cdot \VF{T} - \nabla P  \right) - \nabla \Phi_*, \label{eq:fluid_mom}
\end{align}
where $\rho, P$ and $\VF{v}$ are the fluid density, pressure and velocity respectively, $\VF{T}$ is the viscous stress tensor and $\Phi_*$ is the gravitational potential of the central point mass, which is assumed to dominate over the gravity of the disk. 
Following the review by \citet{papaloizou1995}, we find the corresponding equations of continuity and momentum that describe the evolution of a thin accretion disk.
Rewriting the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates and expanding we find
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot (\rho \VF{v}) &= \partial_t \rho + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \rho v_r) + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi (\rho v_\phi) + \partial_z (\rho v_z) = 0.
\end{align}
Integrating this over all $\phi$ and $z$ gives
\begin{align}
    0 &= \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left\{ \partial_t \rho + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \rho v_r) + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi (\rho v_\phi) + \partial_z (\rho v_z) \right\} \dif{z} \dif{\phi} \\
    &= \partial_t \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho \dif{z} \dif{\phi} + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty r \rho v_r \dif{z} \dif{\phi}, \label{eq:int_cont}
\end{align}
where the third term vanishes and we neglect the fourth term assuming that $v_z \simeq 0$.
Carrying out the integration by assuming $v_r$ is independent of $\phi$ and $z$, equation \ref{eq:int_cont} becomes
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \Sigma + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \Sigma v_r) = 0, \label{eq:1d_cont}
\end{align}
where we assume $\rho$ is independent of $\phi$, and the surface density $\Sigma$ is defined by 
\begin{align}
    \Sigma = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho \dif{z}.
\end{align} 
Equation \ref{eq:1d_cont} expresses that the total mass of the disk is conserved, even as material moves between adjacent annuli. 

Taking the $\phi$ component of the momentum equation gives
\begin{align}
    \partial_t v_\phi + (\VF{v} \cdot \nabla) v_\phi &= \frac{1}{\rho} \left( [\nabla \cdot \VF{T}]_\phi - \nabla_\phi P  \right) - \nabla_\phi \Phi_*.
\end{align}
From equation \ref{eq:point_pot} we see that $\nabla_\phi \Phi_* = 0$. If we assume that the disk is axisymmetric such that $v_\phi=r \Omega(r)$ then we find $\partial_t v_\phi = 0$ and $\nabla_\phi P=0$. 
The $\phi$ components of the remaining terms are given by \citep[eg.][]{armitage2022}
\begin{align}
    [(v \cdot \nabla) \VF{v}]_\phi &= v_r \frac{dv_\phi}{dr} + \frac{v_\phi v_r}{r}, \\
    [\nabla \cdot \VF{T}]_\phi &= \frac{1}{r^2} \partial_r (r^2 T_{r\phi}) + \partial_z T_{\phi z},
\end{align}
giving us
\begin{align}
    v_r \frac{dv_\phi}{dr} + \frac{v_\phi v_r}{r} &= \frac{1}{r^2 \rho} \, \partial_r (r^2 T_{r\phi}) + \frac{1}{\rho} \partial_z T_{\phi z}, \\
    \rho v_r \frac{dh}{dr} &= \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r^2 T_{r\phi}) + r \partial_z T_{\phi z},
\end{align}
where in the second line we have used equation \ref{eq:ang_mom} and multiplied through by  $r \rho$. Integrating over all $\phi$ and $z$, and assuming that $T_{\phi z}$ vanishes as $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
    2\pi \frac{dh}{dr} r v_r \Sigma &= \partial_r \left( r^2 \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty T_{r\phi} \dif{z} \dif{\phi} \right). \label{eq:z_van}
\end{align}
For a thin disk the $r\phi$ component of the viscous stress tensor is simply $\mu r \, d\Omega/dr$ where $\mu$ is the viscosity \citep[see review by][]{papaloizou1995}. 
Let us define the kinematic viscosity $\nu$ as 
\begin{align}
    \nu = \frac{1}{2 \pi \Sigma} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mu \dif{z} \dif{\phi}.
\end{align}
Thus equation \ref{eq:z_van} becomes
\begin{align}
    \Sigma v_r \frac{dh}{dr} &= \frac{1}{r} \partial_r \left( \Sigma r^3 \nu \frac{d\Omega}{dr} \right), \label{eq:1d_angmom}
\end{align}
which expresses that the total angular momentum of the fluid disk is conserved, under our various assumptions.

\subsection{Vertical density structure}

We may derive the vertical structure of the disk following the seminal review by \citet{pringle1981}. Taking the $z$ component of the momentum equation \ref{eq:fluid_mom}, again assuming $v_z \simeq 0$, giving
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{\rho} \partial_z P = \partial_z \Phi_*,
\end{align}
ie. vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. 
Taking the pressure to be dominated by gas and assuming the disk is vertically isothermal with equation of state $P=c_s^2 \rho$ (which may not be a good approximation for protoplanetary disks, see \citet{pinte2018} and \citet{calahan2021}, for example) we find
\begin{align}
    \frac{c_s^2}{\rho} \partial_z \rho = - \frac{G M_* z}{\left(r^2 + z^2\right)^{3/2}} \simeq - \Omega_{\rm K}^2 z.
\end{align}
The approximate equality in the above applies assuming $z \ll r$. 
Solving this yields
\begin{align}
    \rho(r,z) &= \rho_0(r) \exp{\left( -\frac{z^2}{2 H^2} \right)}, \label{eq:vertical_rho}
\end{align}
where $\rho_0(r)$ is the density in the mid-plane at $z=0$, and we define the disk scale height $H = c_s/\Omega_{\rm K}$.
We may also find the relation between $\Sigma$ and $\rho$ by integrating equation \ref{eq:vertical_rho} over all $z$, yielding
\begin{align}
    \rho_0(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} H} \Sigma(r).
\end{align}

\subsection{Rotation}

Taking the radial component of the momentum equation \ref{eq:fluid_mom}, neglecting viscosity, assuming $v_r \ll v_\phi$, and again taking the disk rotation to be axisymmetric
\begin{align}
    \frac{v_\phi^2}{r} &= \frac{G M_* r}{\left( r^2 + z^2  \right)^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{\rho} \partial_r P \simeq \frac{G M_*}{ r^2} + \frac{1}{\rho} \partial_r P, 
\end{align}
again in the second equality using $z \ll r$. Now, dividing each side by $r$ and using $c_s^2=dP/d\rho$
\begin{align}
    \Omega^2 &= \Omega_{\rm K}^2 + \left( \frac{c_s^2}{r^2} \right) \frac{r}{\rho} \frac{d \rho}{dr}, \\
    &= \Omega_{\rm K} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{H}{r}\right)^2 \frac{d \ln{\rho}}{d \ln{r}} \right]^{1/2} . \label{eq:rotation}
\end{align}
Thus we find Keplerian rotation to be a good approximation for disks if $H/r \ll 1$, in regions where $z \ll r$. Additionally, the correction term $d\ln{\rho}/d\ln{r}$ is negative in most astrophysical disks since the density usually decreases with radius, and so the true rotation is sub-Keplerian.

\subsection{Disk flaring}

An accretion disk is said to be flared if its aspect ratio $H/r$ increases with radius so that
\begin{align}
    \frac{H}{r} \propto r^\gamma, \quad \gamma > 0.
\end{align}
That is, the scale height of the disk increases with radius faster than just linearly so $H \propto r^{1+\gamma}$. 
A ``flat" disk has an aspect ratio independent of scale height, $\gamma=0$.
The physical condition for flaring is given by the effective temperature profile of the disk, which we can see by considering that for an ideal gas $c_s^2 \propto T_{\rm eff}$ \citep[eg.][]{pringle2007}, and so
\begin{align}
    \frac{H}{r} &= \frac{c_s}{r \Omega_{\rm K}} \propto \frac{T_{\rm eff}^{1/2}}{r^{-1/2}}.
\end{align}
Thus we see that whether a disk is flared depends on its temperature profile. 
It can be shown that all disks irradiated by a central object are flared \citep{kenyon1987}. 
Indeed, \citet{chiang1997} modelled passive disks around young stars and found approximately $T_{\rm eff} \appropto r^{-1/2}$, which yields $\gamma \simeq 1/4$. 
From equation \ref{eq:rotation}, we see that a consequence of aspect ratio increasing with radius is that the flow becomes increasingly sub-Keplerian in the outer disk.

\subsection{Viscous evolution}

%\begin{figure}
%    \centering
%    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/armitage_ringspread.png}
%    \caption{The evolution of a ring of gas centred initially at $r=r_0$ according to equation \ref{eq:1d_evol}, as derived by \citet{lynden-bell1974}. Each curve is plotted from $\tau=0.008$ to $\tau=0.512$ with interval 0.084, where $\tau$ is dimensionless time \citep[figure from lecture notes by][]{armitage2022}. The diffusive nature of the evolution is clearly evident, with the overdense ring spreading out over time.}
%    \label{fig:ring_spreading}
%\end{figure}

Combining the mass and angular momentum conservation equations \ref{eq:1d_cont} and \ref{eq:1d_angmom}, and substituting the Keplerian forms for $\Omega$ and $h$ in equations \ref{eq:point_pot} and \ref{eq:ang_mom}, we find
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \Sigma &= \frac{3}{r} \partial_r \left[ \sqrt{r} \partial_r \left( \nu \sqrt{r} \Sigma  \right)  \right] \label{eq:1d_evol},
\end{align}
which is the surface density evolution equation for a thin, Keplerian disk. 
This is a partial differential equation, in the form of the 1D diffusion equation.
The diffusive property of the evolution equation is evident in the so-called ring spreading solution derived by \citet{lynden-bell1974} for the case where $\nu$ is constant, as shown in Figure %\ref{fig:ring_spreading}. 
We see that the solution involves the diffusion of a lot of mass to lower radii, while small amounts of mass carry the angular momentum away to very large radii.

In our analysis here and in section \ref{sec:fluid_eqns} we have implicitly used the effective viscous theory of accretion disks, where although angular momentum may physically be transferred by the magnerotational instability \citep{sano2000}, self-gravity \citep{kratter2016}, turbulent eddies \citep{klahr2003}, or other mechanisms, we assume that all of these can be captured considering the problem in terms of a fluid viscosity ($\nu$ in equation \ref{eq:1d_evol}).
Therefore, in order to model disk evolution, we must know how to determine the value of the viscosity $\nu$.
\citet{shakura1973} argued that it is physically consistent to parametrise the viscosity in terms of some constant $\alpha \lesssim 1$ as
\begin{align}
    \nu = \frac{2}{3} \alpha c_s H.
\end{align}
This is known as the $\alpha$-prescription. If $\nu \propto r^\beta$ for some constant $\beta$, then the surface density of a viscous accretion disk is given by \citep{lynden-bell1974}
\begin{align}
    \Sigma(r) = (2 - \beta) \frac{M_d}{2 \pi r_c^2} \left( \frac{r}{r_c} \right)^{-\beta} \exp{\left[ - \left(\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{2-\beta} \right]},
\end{align}
which is an exponentially tapered power law. That is, the density drops approximately as a power law in $-\beta$ with radius for $r < r_c$, and for $r > r_c$ the exponential decay terms dominates. If we use the $\alpha$-prescription and the above definition for $\gamma$ then $\beta=2\gamma+\frac{3}{2}$. 
More commonly this is parametrised in terms of the effective temperature profile $T_{\rm eff} \propto r^{-q}$ for some constant $q$, giving $\beta = \frac{3}{2} - q$ \citep{hartmann1998}. 
If $q=1/2$ as in \citet{chiang1997}, then $\beta=1$.

\section{Spiral Density Waves}

Introduce spiral arms and density waves in the context of observations. Mention Lin-Shu hypothesis and lead into tidal interaction which is what we care about here.

\subsection{Spiral Structure Preliminaries}
We now introduce the following concepts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{pitch angle} $\alpha$: a spiral arm is defined as the angle between the tangent to the spiral at some radius $r$ and the circle with the same radius. 
    Thus $\alpha$ is in general a function of radius and $0 < \alpha < \pi/2$ by definition.
    \item $m$-fold \textit{rotational symmetry}: if a rotation of $2\pi/m$ radians results in no change to the disk surface density, that is $\Sigma(r,\phi)=\Sigma(r,\phi+\frac{2\pi}{m})$, then the disk is said to contain $m$ spiral arms and exhibits an $m$-fold rotational symmetry. 
    For example, a disk containing two spiral arms will be unchanged under a rotation of $180^\circ$ and so has $2$-fold rotational symmetry.
    \item \textit{Leading} and \textit{trailing} spiral arms: the tip of a leading spiral arm points in the direction of the bulk rotation of the disk, while the tip of a trailing arm points in the opposite direction to the rotation. 
    While it seems that leading arms may indeed be physically realised in the universe \citep[eg.][]{vaisanen2008}, they are at minimum very rare. 
    We will be concerned only with trailing spirals in this thesis.
%    \item The \textit{pattern speed} $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$: In the Lin-Shu hypothesis the spiral structure is a fixed pattern that rotates rigidly. 
%    The angular speed of rotation of these spirals according to some intertial observer is known as the pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$. 
%    More generally, the pattern speed is well defined so long as the spirals constitute a steady state solution in some rigidly rotating frame. 
%    As we will see, this is the case for the spiral wake generated by a perturbing planet on a circular orbit, in which case the pattern speed is simply equal to the orbital rotation of the planet
\end{enumerate}

Consider a disk containing a set of $m$ spiral arms such that is has $m$-fold symmetry. We may parameterise the curves defined by the centre of each of the spiral arms as
\begin{align}
    m\phi + f(r,t) = C \,\, \mathrm{mod} \,\, 2\pi, \label{eq:spiral_para}
\end{align}
where $C$ is a constant real number and $f$ is known as the \textit{shape function}. The \textit{radial wavenumber} $k$ is defined in terms of $f$ and is given by
\begin{align}
    k(r,t) \equiv \partial_r f(r,t).
\end{align}
For a counterclockwise rotating disk we have $m>0$ and so $k>0$ corresponds to trailing arms while $k<0$ gives leading arms. 
The opposite is true for clockwise rotating disks with $m<0$. 
We will always assume both $k$ and $m$ are positive, corresponding to tailing arms in a counterclockwise rotating disk. 
The pitch angle of a spiral arm is given by
\begin{align}
    \mathrm{cot}\,\alpha = \left| r \partial_r \phi \right|,
\end{align}
where $r \partial_r \phi$ is evaluated along the curve that defines the spiral. In terms of the parameterisation \ref{eq:spiral_para} we have $\partial_r[m\phi+f(r,t)] = m \partial_r \phi + k = 0$ giving
\begin{align}
    \alpha = \arctan \left( \frac{m}{kr} \right).
\end{align}

\subsection{No Leading Spirals}

In the previous section we stated that while leading spirals may exist in nature, they are at least much rarer that than trailing spirals. 
Indeed, there are \textbf{no} known examples of leading spirals in circumstellar disks.
This state of affairs is at least initially puzzling; if the trailing spiral arms seen in astrophysical disks are steady state solutions governed by Newtonian physics, which is fully time-reversible, surely the corresponding leading spirals solution is entirely equivalent?
\citet{lynden-bell1967} followed this argument to prove the \textit{anti-spiral} theorem, which states that if trailing spirals constitute a steady state solution to time-reversible equations, then there necessarily exists an equivalent leading spiral solution.
Thus the apparent ubiquity of trailing spirals in nature tells us that either the governing physics is not time-reversible, or the spirals are not true steady state solutions.
In the latter case spiral structure may be the result of a recent disturbance, or may be continuously regenerated for example by period tidal forcing.
In the following section we will see that the perturbations driven by a gravitating body embedded in a circumstellar disk result in a trailing spiral structure that is a steady state solution.

\section{The Linear Disk Response}

We examine the linear behaviour of a gas disk perturbed by an embedded gravitating body on a circular orbit.

\subsection{WKB Dispersion Relation}

The 2D inviscid equations of momentum and continuity expressed in terms of surface density are given by 
\begin{align}
    &\partial_t u + u \partial_r u + \frac{v}{r} \partial_\phi u - \frac{v^2}{r} = - \partial_r \Phi - \frac{1}{\Sigma} \partial_r P, \label{eq:mom_eq_u} \\ 
    &\partial_t v + u \partial_r v + \frac{v}{r} \partial_\phi v - \frac{uv}{r} = - \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi \Phi - \frac{1}{r\Sigma} \partial_\phi P, \label{eq:mom_eq_v} \\
    &\partial_t \Sigma + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \Sigma u) + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi (\Sigma v) = 0. 
    \label{eq:cont_2d}
\end{align}
Assuming a polytropic equation of state
\begin{align}
    P = K \Sigma^\gamma,
\end{align}
where $K$ is a constant and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. We then find the sound speed $c$ to be
\begin{align}
    c^2 = \partial_\Sigma P = \gamma K \Sigma^{\gamma-1}. \label{eq:cs_poly}
\end{align}
To simplify the equations we introduce the specific enthalpy $h$. Since the equation of state we are using is isentropic, we have $dh = dP / \Sigma$ giving
\begin{align}
    h = \int \frac{1}{\Sigma} dP = \int \frac{c^2}{\Sigma} d\Sigma = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} K \Sigma^{\gamma-1}. \label{eq:enthalpy}
\end{align}
Note that
\begin{align}
    \partial_x h = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} K \partial_\Sigma (\Sigma^{\gamma-1}) \partial_x \Sigma = \gamma K \Sigma^{\gamma-2} \partial_x \Sigma,
\end{align}
such that the right-hand sides of equations \ref{eq:mom_eq_u} and \ref{eq:mom_eq_v} become
\begin{align}
    - \partial_r \Phi - \frac{1}{\Sigma} \partial_r P = - \partial_r \Phi - \gamma K \Sigma^{\gamma-2} \partial_r \Sigma = - \partial_r (\Phi + h) \label{eq:mom_u_RHS},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    - \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi \Phi - \frac{1}{r\Sigma} \partial_\phi P = - \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi (\Phi + h) \label{eq:mom_v_RHS},
\end{align}
respectively.

We now perform a linear perturbation study; we assume that the spiral waves in the disk constitute only a small perturbation from some background steady-state, and that the background state is axisymmetric.
We rewrite the quantities $\Sigma,\Phi,h,u,v$ as a combination of the background value (denoted by subscript 0) and a small perturbation  (denoted by $\delta$)
\begin{align}
    \Sigma &= \Sigma_0 + \delta\Sigma \label{eq:pertsig} \\
    \Phi &= \Phi_0 + \delta\Phi \label{eq:pertphi} \\
    h &= h_0 + \delta h \label{eq:perth} \\
    v &= v_0 + \delta v \label{eq:pertv} \\ 
    u &= \delta u, \label{eq:pertu}
\end{align}
where we note that $u_0=0$ since we assume no radial motion in the background state.
From equations \ref{eq:mom_eq_u} and \ref{eq:mom_u_RHS}, and making use of the axisymmetry of the background state, we find the equation of motion for the background
\begin{align}
    \frac{v_0^2}{r} = \partial_r \left( \Phi_0 + h_0  \right), \label{eq:pertback}
\end{align}
which is the 2D equivalent of equation \ref{eq:rotation}. 
Substituting \ref{eq:pertsig}-\ref{eq:pertu} into equations \ref{eq:mom_eq_u}, \ref{eq:mom_eq_v}, \ref{eq:mom_u_RHS}, \ref{eq:mom_v_RHS}, discarding second order terms, and subtracting equation \ref{eq:pertback} yields the linearised equations of motion 
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \delta u + \Omega \partial_\phi \delta u - 2 \Omega \delta v &= - \partial_r \left( \delta \Phi + \delta h  \right) \label{eq:mom_u_lin} \\
    \partial_t \delta v + \Omega \partial_\phi \delta v - 2 B \delta u &= - \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi \left( \delta \Phi + \delta h  \right), \label{eq:mom_v_lin}
\end{align}
where we have also substituted $v_0=\Omega r$ and the second Oort constant $B = -r \partial_r \Omega / 2 -\Omega$, which is related to the epicyclic frequency as $\kappa^2 = -4 B \Omega$. 
The linearised equation of continuity is obtained similarly from \ref{eq:cont_2d}
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \delta \Sigma + \frac{1}{r} \partial_r \left( r \Sigma_0 \delta u  \right) + \frac{\Sigma_0}{r} \partial_\phi \delta v + \Omega \partial_\phi \delta \Sigma. \label{eq:cont_lin}
\end{align}
We assume that the equations of motion \ref{eq:mom_u_lin} and \ref{eq:mom_v_lin} are solved by a summation of plane waves, where each perturbed quantity $a \in \left\{ \Sigma, \Phi, h, v, u \right\}$ can be written as
\begin{align}
    \delta a = \sum_m \delta a_m = \sum_m a_m(r) \exp \left[ i (m\phi - \omega t) \right]; \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}^{0+}, \label{eq:pert_sum_form}
\end{align}
where each $m$ component of the perturbation has $m$-fold symmetry and $a_m(r)$ is in general a complex function.
The physical perturbation is obtained by taking the real component $\mathrm{Re}(\delta a)$.
Substituting the summands of \ref{eq:pert_sum_form} in place of the perturbations in our linearised equations yields
\begin{align}
    u_m (r) &= \frac{i}{\Delta} \left[ (\omega - m \Omega) \partial_r (\Phi_m + h_m) - \frac{2 m \Omega}{r} (\Phi_m + h_m) \right] \label{eq:lin_u_m} \\
    v_m (r) &= - \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ 2B \partial_r (\Phi_m + h_m) + \frac{m(\omega - m \Omega)}{r} (\Phi_m + h_m) \right] \label{eq:lin_v_m} \\
    \Sigma_m (r) &= \frac{1}{r(\omega - m \Omega)} \left[ m \Sigma_0 v_m -i \partial_r (r u_m \Sigma_0) \right] \label{eq:lin_cont_m},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    \Delta \equiv \kappa^2 - (\omega - m \Omega)^2.
\end{align}
Finally, we must linearise the equation of state.
Taking equation \ref{eq:enthalpy} and expanding in $\delta \Sigma_m / \Sigma_0$
\begin{align}
    h_0 + \delta h = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} K \Sigma_0^{\gamma - 1}(1 + \frac{\delta\Sigma}{\Sigma_0})^{\gamma-1} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} K \Sigma_0^{\gamma - 1} + \gamma K \Sigma_0^{\gamma-1} \frac{\delta\Sigma}{\Sigma_0} + \mathcal{O}(\left(\delta\Sigma / \Sigma_0\right)^2).
\end{align}
Now substituting equations \ref{eq:cs_poly} and \ref{eq:enthalpy}, and taking only one component of the perturbation, we find
\begin{align}
    h_m \simeq c_0^2 \frac{\Sigma_m}{\Sigma_0}, \label{eq:lin_EOS_m}
\end{align}
where $c_0$ is the unperturbed sound speed.

With equations \ref{eq:lin_u_m}, \ref{eq:lin_v_m}, \ref{eq:lin_cont_m} and \ref{eq:lin_EOS_m} we have four constraints on the five state variables $\Sigma_m, \Phi_m, h_m, v_m$ and $u_m$.
We therefore now have a system of equations describing the \textit{linear response} of the disk $\Sigma_m$ for the azimuthal wave mode $m$, to the potential component $\Phi_m$.
By summing over all modes, we can calculate the global response of the disk to some imposed gravitational potential.

\subsubsection{Tightly-Wound Density Waves}

We now apply the WKB approximation, which consists of assuming that
