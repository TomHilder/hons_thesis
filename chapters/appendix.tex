Let $F(x)$ be a slowly and smoothly varying function of $x$, and that $F(x)$ is of roughly constant order for all $x$. 
We will therefore represent $F$ by a fractional power series where the highest order term is at most linear:
\begin{align}
    F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n x^{\frac{n}{N}}, \label{eq:powerseries}
\end{align}
for some set of constant coefficients ${a_n}$ where many may be equal to zero and for some positive integer $N$. 
The derivative of $F$ is then
\begin{align}
    F'(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{n}{N} a_n x^{\frac{n}{N}-1},
\end{align}
Taking the limit of $F'$ we find
\begin{align}
    \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} F'(x) &= \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{a_1}{N} x^{\frac{1}{N}-1} + \frac{2a_2}{N} x^{\frac{2}{N}-1} + \cdots + a_N \right) \\
    &= a_N.
\end{align}
Thus $F'$ is asymptotically of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for any value of $a_N$.
