\noindent This thesis presents a complete account of the research I have completed as a part of my honours year.
In April of this year my first scientific paper was published, where I was second-author, based on work done in my final year of undergraduate studies\footnote{\citealt{calcino2022}}.
The work done in that paper constitutes the necessary groundwork for the research presented here.
This year I have additionally contributed to two further publications on the kinematic detection of young planets, working as part of the SPH group here at Monash\footnote{\citealt{verrios2022}}\footnote{\citealt{garg2022}}.
I am also an author on a manuscript in preparation concerned with testing the theory of velocity kinks, led by our collaborators at the University of Milan in Italy\footnote{Fasano et al., in prep.}.
Finally, I produced my first leading-author paper, on the software package I wrote to produce semi-analytic models of planet wakes, which has been submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software and is currently in review\footnote{Hilder et al., submitted.}.
My contributions to each of these projects, as well as the other work I completed in my honours year, are presented in this document.


%In that work  we mapped the planet wake in the disk of HD~163296 through kinematics, constituting the first detection of its kind.
