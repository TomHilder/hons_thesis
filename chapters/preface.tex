\noindent This thesis presents a complete account of the research I have completed as a part of my honours year, building on work done in the final year of my undergraduate studies.
During the year I published my first scientific paper, as the second-author in collaboration with Josh Calcino, where we mapped the planet wake in the disk of HD~163296 through kinematics.
This work constitutes the first detection of its kind\footnote{\citealt{calcino2022}}. 
I additionally contributed to two further publications on the kinematic detection of young planets, working as part of the SPH group here at Monash\footnote{\citealt{verrios2022}}\footnote{\citealt{garg2022}}.
I am also an author on a manuscript in preparation concerned with testing theory of velocity kinks, lead by our collaborators at the University of Milan in Italy\footnote{\citeauthor{fasanoinprep.} in prep.}.
Finally, I produced my first leading-author paper on the software package I wrote to produce semi-analytic models of planet wakes, which has been submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software and is currently in review\footnote{\citeauthor{hildersubmitted} submitted}.
My contributions to each of these projects, as well as the other work I completed in my honours year, are presented in this document.
