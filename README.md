# Honours Thesis:

My Honours thesis, which I completed in 2022 as part of the final year of my undergraduate degree at Monash University.

#### Abstract:

We present a semi-analytic framework for detecting and measuring planets through measurements of their spiral wakes in observations of protoplanetary disk kinematics. Building on previous work, we provide improvements to the accuracy and speed of semi-analytic models for the planet-disk interac- tion, and present our Python package wakeflow that can readily generate these models in a few seconds. This work is then used to constrain potential planets in observations of the circumstellar disks of HD 163296, HD 169142, and IM Lupi by modelling the signatures of planet wakes present in molecular line emission. Finally, we present our preliminary work on the development of a fitting procedure for planet mass, using wakeflow models.
